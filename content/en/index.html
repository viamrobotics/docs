Robotics has the potential to do so much good, but progress has been slowed by complicated hardware and software integrations, long development cycles, and people's fear of tripping over a robot on their way to work.

At Viam, we are addressing these issues by building a novel robotics platform that relies on standardized building blocks rather than custom code to create, configure and control robots intuitively and quickly. Weâ€™re empowering engineers - aspiring and experienced - across industries to solve complicated automation problems with our innovative software tools.
