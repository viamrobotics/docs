The Viam registry hosts custom Python ML training scripts, which you can use to train custom machine learning models.
You can upload your own training script by following the guide to [Train a Model with a Custom Python Training Script](/how-tos/create-custom-training-scripts/).

You can search the available ML training scripts from the Viam registry here:
