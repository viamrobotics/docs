The movement sensor component provides an API for GPS location, linear velocity and acceleration, angular velocity and acceleration and heading.

If you have hardware or software that provides such measurements, use a movement sensor component.

## Available models

To use a movement sensor and get its measurements, you need to add it to your machine's configuration.

Go to your machine's **CONFIGURE** page, and add a model that supports your sensor.

The following list shows the available sensor models.
For additional configuration information, click on the model name:

## API

The [movement sensor API](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/) supports the following methods:

Different movement sensors provide different data, so be aware that not all of the methods below are supported by all movement sensors.

You can run `GetProperties` on your sensor for a list of its supported methods.

## Troubleshooting

You can find additional assistance in the [Troubleshooting section](/appendix/troubleshooting/).

You can also ask questions on the [Viam Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/viamrobotics/shared_invite/zt-1f5xf1qk5-TECJc1MIY1MW0d6ZCg~Wnw) and we will be happy to help.

To capture data from the movement sensor or use it for motion, see the following services:

- [data management service](/services/data/): to capture and sync the movement sensor's data
- [motion service](/services/motion/): to move machines or components of machines
- [navigation service](/services/navigation/): to navigate with GPS
- [SLAM service](/services/slam/): for mapping
