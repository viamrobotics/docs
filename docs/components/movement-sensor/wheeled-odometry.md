Configure a `wheeled-odometry` movement sensor to implement _wheeled odometry_ on your machine.

_Wheeled odometry_ is the estimation of the rate of change of position, orientation, linear velocity, and angular velocity using the dimensions of a base, calculated by measuring the movement of the motors through encoders.
Because of this method of estimation, you don't have to have a specific piece of movement sensor hardware to implement `wheeled-odometry` on your machine.
This model uses [encoders](/components/encoder/) from [position reporting motors](/components/motor/) to get an odometry estimate of a wheeled base as it moves.

With a configured `wheeled-odometry` movement sensor, your machine calculates an estimation of the position, orientation, linear velocity, and angular velocity of the wheeled base each time `time_interval_msec` elapses during a [session](/appendix/apis/sessions/).
You can access these readings through the [movement sensor API](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#api).
For the best accuracy with odometry calculations, it is recommended you configure a time interval of less than `1000` milliseconds.

After configuring a `wheeled-odometry` movement sensor, you can operate your base with Viam's built-in services like the [navigation service](/services/navigation/).

## Set-up requirements

To prepare your machine, attach [encoders](/components/encoder/) to each of the position-reporting motors on your base to measure their rotation.

- Select motors that can report their own position, like [`gpio` motors](/components/motor/gpio/) with [encoders](/components/encoder/#configuration), or the [`odrive` module](https://github.com/viam-modules/odrive).
  You can access this property of a configured motor through the [motor API's `GetProperties()`](/appendix/apis/components/motor/#getproperties).
- Configure your rover as a [wheeled base component](/components/base/wheeled/).
  Make sure to configure the base width and circumference, as these measurements as a property of the base are vital for accurate odometry estimations by your movement sensor.
  This movement sensor accesses these values through the base's `GetProperties()` API method.
- Configure each of the position-reporting motors [as motor components](/components/motor/).
- Then, proceed to [configure](#configuration) a `wheeled-odometry` movement sensor with the name of each of the motor components.

## Configuration

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of your machine's page in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Click the **+** icon next to your machine part in the left-hand menu and select **Component**.
Select the `movement-sensor` type, then select the `wheeled-odometry` model.
Enter a name or use the suggested name for your movement sensor and click **Create**.

## Attributes

The following attributes are available for `wheeled-odometry` movement sensors:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Name | Type | Required? | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `base` | string | **Required** | The `name` of the [base](/components/base/) to which the encoders making up this movement sensor are wired. |
| `left_motors` | object | **Required** | A list containing the name of each of the bases' left [position-reporting motors](/components/motor/gpio/). |
| `right_motors` | object | **Required** | A list containing the name of each of the bases' right [position-reporting motors](/components/motor/gpio/). |
| `time_interval_msec` | float | Optional | The time in milliseconds between each wheeled odometry calculation.<br>Default: `500.0`</br> |

## Test the movement sensor

After you configure your movement sensor, navigate to the [Control tab](/fleet/control/) and select the dedicated movement sensor dropdown panel.
This panel presents the data collected by the movement sensor.
