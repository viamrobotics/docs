The `cameramono` movement sensor model is an **experimental** model that uses a visual odometry algorithm with dead reckoning to track the position, orientation, linear velocity and angular velocity of the camera's frame.
The `cameramono` model can use any single [camera](/components/camera/) within its algorithm.
