{{% alert title="Stability Notice" color="note" %}}

The `gps-nmea-rtk-pmtk` model is an experimental feature.
Stability is not guaranteed.
Breaking changes are likely to occur, and occur often.

A global positioning system (GPS) receives signals from satellites in the earthâ€™s orbit to determine where it is and how fast it is going.
All supported GPS models provide data for the `Position`, `CompassHeading` and `LinearVelocity` methods.
You can obtain fix and correction data by using the sensor `GetReadings` method, which is available because GPSes wrap the [sensor component](../../../sensor/).

The `gps-ntrip` <!-- this isn't a model. What should this say? --> movement sensor model supports [NTRIP-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networked_Transport_of_RTCM_via_Internet_Protocol) [real time kinematic positioning (RTK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning) GPS units ([such as these](https://www.sparkfun.com/rtk)).

The chip requires a correction source to get to the required positional accuracy.
The `gps-nmea-rtk-pmtk` model uses an over-the-internet correction source and sends the data over I<sup>2</sup>C.
