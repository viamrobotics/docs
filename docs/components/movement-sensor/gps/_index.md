A global positioning system (GPS) receives signals from satellites in the earthâ€™s orbit to determine where it is and how fast it is going.
All supported GPS models provide date for the `Position`, `CompassHeading` and `LinearVelocity` methods.
Fix and Correction data are available by using the sensor `GetReadings` method, which is available because GPSes wrap the [sensor component](../../sensor/).
