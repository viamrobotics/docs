The camera component provides an API for getting images or point clouds.

If you have a physical camera or software that generates 2D images or 3D point clouds, use a camera component.

You can use the camera component to configure a webcam, lidar, time-of-flight sensor, or another type of camera.
You can also use camera models to manipulate the output of other cameras to transform, crop, or otherwise change the output.

## Configuration

To use a camera with your machine, you need to add it to your machine's configuration.
Go to your machine's **CONFIGURE** page, and add a model that supports your camera.

The following list shows the available camera models.
The configuration of your camera component depends on your camera model.
For additional configuration information, click on the model name:

{{< readfile "/static/include/create-your-own-mr.md" >}}

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Model | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [`fake`](fake-micro-server/) | A camera model for testing. |
| [`esp32-camera`](esp32-camera/) | A camera on an ESP32. |

## API

The [camera API](/appendix/apis/components/camera/) supports the following methods:

## Troubleshooting

If your camera is not working as expected, follow these steps:

1. Check your machine logs on the **LOGS** tab to check for errors.

2. Review your camera model's documentation to ensure you have configured all required attributes.
3. Click on the **TEST** panel on the **CONFIGURE** or **CONTROL** tab and test if you can use the camera there.

If none of these steps work, reach out to us on the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/viam) and we will be happy to help.

### Common errors

{{% expand "Failed to find the best driver that fits the constraints" %}}

When working with a [camera](/components/camera/) component, depending on the camera, you may need to explicitly provide some camera-specific configuration parameters.

Check the specifications for your camera, and manually provide configuration parameters such as width and height to the camera component configuration page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
On the **CONFIGURE** page, find your camera, then fill in your camera's specific configuration either using the **Show more** button to show the relevant configuration options, or the **{}** (Switch to Advanced) button in the top right of the component panel to enter these attributes manually.
Provide at least the width and height values to start.

You can also use the camera component with the following services:

- [Data management service](/services/data/): To capture and sync the camera's data
- [Vision service](/services/vision/): To use computer vision to interpret the camera stream
- [SLAM service](/services/slam/): for mapping
