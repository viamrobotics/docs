A camera component is a source of 2D and/or 3D images.
You can use the component to configure a webcam, lidar, time-of-flight sensor, or another type of camera.

The API for camera components allows you to:

- Request single images or a stream in 2D color, or display z-depth.

- Request a point cloud.
  Each 3D point cloud image consists of a set of coordinates (x,y,z) representing depth in mm.

The configuration of your camera component depends on your camera model.
You can use different models to:

- Configure physical cameras that generate images or point clouds.
- Combine streams from multiple cameras into one.
- Transform and process images.

## Control your camera with Viam's client SDK libraries

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your machine, go to your machine's page on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code generated.

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

When executed, this sample code will create a connection to your machine as a client.
Then control your machine programmatically by adding API method calls as shown in the following examples.

These examples assume you have a camera called `"my_camera"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your camera has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Be sure to import the camera package for the SDK you are using:
