The motor component provides an API for operating a motor or getting its current status.

If you have a device that converts electricity into rotary motion, such as a brushed DC motor, a brushless DC motor, or a stepper motor, configure it as a motor component.

If you have a hobby servo, configure it as a [servo component](/components/servo/) instead.

## Available models

To use a motor, you need to add it to your machine's configuration.
Go to your machine's **CONFIGURE** page, and add a model that supports your motor.

Because your machine controls your motor using a [motor driver](https://www.wellpcb.com/what-is-motor-driver.html), you technically need to select a motor model that supports your motor driver rather than the motor itself.

The following list shows the available motor models.
For additional configuration information, click on the model name:

## Troubleshooting

You can find additional assistance in the [Troubleshooting section](/appendix/troubleshooting/).

You can also ask questions on the [Viam Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/viamrobotics/shared_invite/zt-1f5xf1qk5-TECJc1MIY1MW0d6ZCg~Wnw) and we will be happy to help.
