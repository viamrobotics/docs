The `28byj48` model of the motor component supports small unipolar [stepper motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor) controlled by stepper motor drivers like [ULN2003](https://www.ti.com/product/ULN2003A). The `28byj48` is often used for low-current and low-precision applications and supports full, half, and quarter stepping with 2048 steps in a rotation in full-step mode.

Viam also supports:

- stepper motors with higher step resolution with the [`gpiostepper`](../gpiostepper) model
- advanced stepper driver chips like [TMC5072](../tmc5072/) or [DMC4000](../dmc4000/) that have their own microcontrollers that handle things like speed and acceleration control

To configure a `28byj48` motor as a component of your robot, first configure the [board](/components/board/) to which the motor driver is wired.
Then, add the motor:

{{< tabs name="gpiostepper-config">}}
{{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

Navigate to the **Config** tab of your robot's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Click on the **Components** subtab and navigate to the **Create component** menu.
Enter a name for your motor, select the type `motor`, and select the `28byj48` model.

Click **Create component** and then fill in the attributes for your model:

Example configuration for a `28byj48` stepper motor:

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "example-board",
      "type": "board",
      "model": "pi"
    },

The following attributes are available for `28byj48` motors:

| Name | Type | Inclusion | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `board` | string | **Required** | Should match name of board to which the motor driver is wired. |
| `pins` | object | **Required** | A json object containing `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, and `in4` pin numbers. |
| `ticks_per_rotation` | int | **Required** | Number of full steps in a rotation. The motor takes 5.625*(1/64)° per step, 4096 steps is 360°. One full rotation is 4096 steps. |

Refer to your motor and motor driver data sheets for specifics.
