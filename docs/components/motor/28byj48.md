The `28byj48` model of the motor component supports small unipolar [stepper motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor) controlled by stepper motor drivers like [ULN2003](https://www.ti.com/product/ULN2003A). The `28byj48` is often used for low-current and low-precision applications and supports full, half, and quarter stepping with 4096 steps in a rotation in full-step mode.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
Viam also supports:

- stepper motors with higher step resolution with the [`gpiostepper`](../gpiostepper/) model
- advanced stepper driver chips like [TMC5072](../tmc5072/) or [DMC4000](../dmc4000/) that have their own microcontrollers that handle things like speed and acceleration control

{{< /alert >}}

To configure a `28byj48` motor as a component of your machine, first configure the [board](/components/board/) to which the motor driver is wired.
Then, add the motor:

{{< tabs name="gpiostepper-config">}}
{{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Click the **+** icon next to your machine part in the left-hand menu and select **Component**.
Select the `motor` type, then select the `28byj48` model.
Enter a name or use the suggested name for your motor and click **Create**.

The following attributes are available for `28byj48` motors:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Name | Type | Inclusion | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `board` | string | **Required** | `name` of the [board](/components/board/) the motor driver is wired to. |
| `pins` | object | **Required** | A JSON object containing the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="pin-number" text="pin numbers" >}} the `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, and `in4` pins of the motor driver are wired to on the [board](/components/board/). |
| `ticks_per_rotation` | int | **Required** | Number of full steps in a rotation. The motor takes 5.625*(1/64)° per step. One full rotation (360°) is 4096 steps. |

Refer to your motor and motor driver data sheets for specifics.

The driver is connected to a Raspberry Pi with four wires labeled IN1, IN2, IN3, and IN4. These are connected to Pi pins 11, 12, 13 and 15, respectively. A separate 12V power supply is attached to the motor driver to power the motor.](/components/motor/28byj48-wiring.png)
