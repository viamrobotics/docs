The `28byj48` model of the motor component supports small unipolar [stepper motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor) controlled by stepper motor drivers like [ULN2003](https://www.ti.com/product/ULN2003A). The `28byj48` is often used for low-current and low-precision applications and supports full, half, and quarter stepping with 4096 steps in a rotation in full-step mode.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
Viam also supports:

- stepper motors with higher step resolution with the [`gpiostepper`](../gpiostepper/) model
- advanced stepper driver chips like [TMC5072](../tmc5072/) or [DMC4000](../dmc4000/) that have their own microcontrollers that handle things like speed and acceleration control

{{< /alert >}}

To configure a `28byj48` motor as a component of your machine, first configure the [board](/components/board/) to which the motor driver is wired.
Then, add the motor:

{{< tabs name="gpiostepper-config">}}
{{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

Navigate to the **Config** tab of your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Click on the **Components** subtab and click **Create component**.
Select the `motor` type, then select the `28byj48` model.
Enter a name for your motor and click **Create**.

The following attributes are available for `28byj48` motors:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Name | Type | Inclusion | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `board` | string | **Required** | `name` of the [board](/components/board/) the motor driver is wired to. |
| `pins` | object | **Required** | A JSON object containing the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="pin-number" text="pin numbers" >}} the `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, and `in4` pins of the motor driver are wired to on the [board](/components/board/). |
| `ticks_per_rotation` | int | **Required** | Number of full steps in a rotation. The motor takes 5.625*(1/64)° per step. One full rotation (360°) is 4096 steps. |
| `control_parameters` | object | Optional | A JSON object containing the coefficients for the proportional, integrative, and derivative terms. If you use `{ "p": 0, "i": 0, "d": 0 }`, `viam-server` auto-tunes the values and logs the values. Tuning takes several seconds and spins the motors. To avoid tuning every time the robot starts up, copy the values from the log and add them to the configuration once tuned. For more information see [Control motor velocity with a sensor](#control-motor-velocity-with-a-sensor). |

Refer to your motor and motor driver data sheets for specifics.

The driver is connected to a Raspberry Pi with four wires labeled IN1, IN2, IN3, and IN4. These are connected to Pi pins 11, 12, 13 and 15, respectively. A separate 12V power supply is attached to the motor driver to power the motor.](/components/motor/28byj48-wiring.png)
