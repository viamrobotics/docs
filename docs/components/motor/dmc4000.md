This model supports stepper motors controlled by [DMC-40x0 series motion controllers](https://www.galil.com/motion-controllers/multi-axis/dmc-40x0).

Whereas a basic low-level stepper driver supported by the [`gpiostepper` model](/components/motor/gpiostepper/) sends power to a stepper motor based on PWM signals from GPIO pins, the DMC40x0 motion controller has many motion control features.
It does not require a [board component](/components/board/) to be configured because it handles computation and signal creation on the motion controller itself.

The DMC-40x0 controller can drive a variety of motor types, but the built-in Viam implementation supports only stepper motors at this time.
Other types of motors could be driven by Viam and the DMC-40x0 by [creating a custom motor model](/program/extend/).
