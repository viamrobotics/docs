This model supports stepper motors controlled by the [TMC5072 chip](https://www.trinamic.com/support/eval-kits/details/tmc5072-bob/).

Whereas a basic low-level stepper driver supported by the `gpiostepper` model sends power to a stepper motor based on PWM signals from GPIO pins, the TMC5072 chip uses SPI bus to communicate with the board, does some processing on the chip itself, and provides convenient features including StallGuard2<sup>TM</sup>.

### Example Config

#### Required Attributes

Name | Type | Description
-------------- | ---- | ---------------
`board` | string | Should match name of board to which the motor controller is wired.
`spi_bus` | string |
`chip_select` | string |
`pins` | object | A structure containing "step" and "dir" pin numbers; see example JSON above.
`ticks_per_rotation` | integer | Number of full steps in a rotation. 200 (equivalent to 1.8 degrees per step) is very common.

#### Optional Attributes

Name | Type | Description
-------------- | ---- | ---------------
`stepper_delay` | uint | Time in microseconds to remain high for each step. Default is 20.
`max_acceleration_rpm_per_sec` | float64 |
