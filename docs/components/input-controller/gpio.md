Configuring a `gpio` input controller allows you to use a GPIO or ADC based device to communicate with your robot.

## Configuration

Refer to the following example configuration for an input controller of model `gpio` with a GPIO based device serving as the board component.

Be aware that complete configuration is not visible in the "Config Builder" tab:

The following attributes are available for `gpio` input controllers:

| Name | Inclusion | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `board` | *Required* | The name of the board component with GPIO or ADC pins to use as the controlling device. |
| `buttons` | *Required* | The [Buttons](../#button-controls) available for control. These should be connected to the GPIO/ADC board. <pre> **Each buttons's fields:** <br><br> <code>name</code>: Name of the Digital Interrupt the button/switch is connected to, as configured on the board component. <br><br> <code>control</code>: The [Control](../#control-field) type to use when reporting events as this button's state is changed. <br><br> <code>invert</code>: Boolean indicating if the digital input (high/low) should be inverted when reporting button Control value indicating button state. <br> This option is given because digital switches vary between high, `1`, and low, `0`, as their default at rest. <pre> *true:* `0` is pressed, and `1` is released. <br> *false (default):* `0` is released, and `1` is pressed. </pre> <code>debounce_ms</code>: How many milliseconds to wait for the interrupt to settle. This is needed because some switches can be electrically noisy. </pre> |
| `axes` | *Required* | The [Axes](../#axis-controls) available for control. These should be connected to the GPIO/ADC board. <pre> **Each axis's fields:** <br><br> <code>name</code>: Name of the Analog Reader that reports ADC values for the axis Control, as configured on the board component. <br><br> <code>control</code>: The [Control](../#control-field) type to use when reporting events as this axis's position is changed. <br><br> <code>min</code>: The minimum ADC value that the analog reader can report as this axis's position changes. <br><br> <code>max</code>: The maximum ADC value that the analog reader can report as this axis's position changes. <br><br> <code>deadzone</code>: The absolute ADC value change from the neutral `0` point to still consider as a neutral position. This option is given so tiny wiggles on loose controls don't result in events being reported. <br><br> <code>min_change</code>: The minimum absolute ADC value change from the previous ADC value reading that can occur before reporting a new [`PositionChangeAbs Event`](../#event-object). This option is given so tiny wiggles on loose controls don't result in events being reported. <br><br> <code>bidirectional</code>: Boolean indicating if the axis changes position in 1 direction, like on an analog trigger or pedal, or 2, like on an analog control stick. <pre> *true:* The axis should report center, `0`, as halfway between the min/max ADC values. <br> *false:* `0` is still the neutral point of the axis, but only positive change values can be reported. </pre> <code>poll_hz</code>: How many times per second to check for a new ADC reading that can generate an event. <br><br> <code>invert</code>: Boolean indicating if the direction of the axis should be flipped when translating ADC value readings to the axis Control value indicating position change. <pre> *true:* flips the direction of the axis so that the minimum ADC value is reported as the maximum axis Control value. <br> *false:* keeps the direction of the axis the same, so that the minimum ADC value is reported as the minimum axis Control value. </pre></pre>|
