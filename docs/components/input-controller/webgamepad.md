Configuring a `webgamepad` input controller allows you to use a web-based gamepad as a device to communicate with your robot.

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
You **must** use "WebGamepad" as the `name` of the web gamepad controller. This restriction will be removed in the future.

Use the following configuration for an input controller of model `webgamepad`:

## Usage

Connect your controller to your computer.
Follow the instructions included with your gamepad to make this connection.

If you haven't done so already, create a robot in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), and follow the instructions in the **SETUP** tab to start `viam-server` on your computer and connect to the robot.

Then, click on the robot's **CONFIG** tab and configure an `input_controller` component of model `webgamepad` and name `WebGamepad`, as shown above.
Save the config.

Next, navigate to the **CONTROL** tab.
You should see a `WebGamepad` drop-down menu.
Click on the drop-down menu to expand it.
Click **Enable**, and press a button on your controller.
Then, you should see the [Controls](../#control-field) on your input controller appear:

<img src="../img/gamepad-enabled-app.png" alt="The dropdown as a table of controls available and their inputs in the Control tab of the Viam app. This is for a WebGamepad model." style="width:100%"/>

<br>

You should now be able to see the row of control inputs respond to your button presses and stick toggles.

For example, this is how the row of [Controls](../#control-field) appears after pressing the circle (west) button on the button pad of the connected PS4 controller:

<img src="../img/gamepad-enabled-app-with-input.png" alt="The dropdown as a table of controls available for a web-based gamepad and their inputs in the Control tab of the Viam app." style="width:100%"/>

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
You have to press a button or move a stick on your gamepad for the browser to report the gamepad.
For your security, the browser won't report a gamepad until an input has been sent.
