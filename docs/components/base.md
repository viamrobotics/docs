# Base Component
Most robots with wheeled bases will comprise at least the following:

-   A `board` component that can run a Viam server instance. 
That is to say, a computing device with general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins such as a Raspberry Pi or other single-board computer with GPIO.

-   Two or more motors with wheels attached

-   A power supply for the board

-   A power supply for the motors

-   Some sort of chassis to hold everything together

For example:

An example of a wiring diagram for a base that has one motor on each side is shown below.
Note that this will vary greatly depending on choice of motors, motor drivers, power supply, and board.

## Configuration

Configuring a base involves configuring the drive motors and ensuring the base attributes section contains the names of all motors that move the base right or left, respectively.
Configure each motor according to its type. 
You can find more information on wiring and configuring different types of motors under the [Motor Component](https://docs.viam.com/components/motor/).
The board controlling the base must also be configured.

An example configuration file, including the board, motors, and base:

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "attributes": {},
      "model": "pi",
      "name": "follow-pi",
      "type": "board"
    },
    {
      "attributes": {
        "board": "follow-pi",
        "max_rpm": 300,
        "pins": {
          "dir": "16",
          "pwm": "15"
        }
      },
      "depends_on": [
        "follow-pi"
      ],
      "model": "gpio",
      "name": "rightm",
      "type": "motor"
    },
    {
      "attributes": {
        "board": "follow-pi",
        "max_rpm": 300,
        "pins": {
          "dir": "13",
          "pwm": "11"
        }
      },
      "depends_on": [
        "follow-pi"
      ],
      "model": "gpio",
      "name": "leftm",
      "type": "motor"
    },
    {
      "attributes": {
        "left": [
          "leftm"
        ],
        "right": [
          "rightm"
        ],
        "wheel_circumference_mm": 183,
        "width_mm": 195
      },
      "depends_on": [
        "rightm",
        "leftm"
      ],
      "model": "wheeled",
      "name": "tread-base",
      "type": "base"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Optional Attributes

`spin_slip_factor` (float): Used in steering calculations to correct for slippage between the wheels and the floor.
To be calibrated by the user.
