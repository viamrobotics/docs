The power sensor component provides an API for getting measurements of voltage, current, and power consumption.

If you have a physical power sensor, an API endpoint, or anything else that provides such measurements, use a power sensor component.

## Configuration

To use a power sensor and get its measurements, you need to add it to your machine's configuration.

Go to your machine's **CONFIGURE** page, and add a model that supports your sensor.

The following list shows the available sensor models.
For additional configuration information, click on the model name:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="viam-server" %}}

{{<resources api="rdk:component:power_sensor" type="power_sensor" no-intro="true">}}

{{< readfile "/static/include/create-your-own-mr.md" >}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="viam-micro-server" %}}

{{< alert title="Support Notice" color="note" >}}

There is currently no support for this component in `viam-micro-server`.

## API

The [power sensor API](/appendix/apis/components/power-sensor/) supports the following methods:

## Troubleshooting

If your power sensor is not working as expected, follow these steps:

1. Check your machine logs on the **LOGS** tab to check for errors.
2. Review your power sensor model's documentation to ensure you have configured all required attributes.
3. Click on the **TEST** panel on the **CONFIGURE** or **CONTROL** tab and test if you can use the power sensor there.

If none of these steps work, reach out to us on the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/viam) and we will be happy to help.
