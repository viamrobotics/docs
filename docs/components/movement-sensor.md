The movement sensor component is an abstraction of a sensor that gives data on where a robot is and how fast it is moving.

We have chosen to abstract these types of sensors into one common API.
There are many different types of sensors that can provide data for some or all of the following methods: `Position`, `Orientation`, `LinearVelocity`, `AngularVelocity` and `CompassHeadings`.
A global positioning system (GPS) can provide position, linear velocity and compass headings.
An inertial measurement unit (IMU) can provide angular velocity and orientation.
We can further apply algorithms, such as a [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter), to combine data from both a GPS and an IMU to output the full set of information of the movement sensor methods.

Currently (12 December 2022), the Viam [RDK](../../appendix/glossary/#rdk_anchor) supports two [IMU models](#imu) (manufactured by WitMotion and VectorNav), a [gyroscope/accelerometer](#mpu6050) from TDK InvenSense, and two [GPS models](#gps): [NMEA-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) GPS modules and [NTRIP-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networked_Transport_of_RTCM_via_Internet_Protocol) [RTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning) GPS models.
The `cameramono` RDK model is experimental and uses a camera to output data on its position and orientation (from visual odometry).

We specifically cover GPS and IMU units in this documentation.

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
Any movement sensor that uses I<sup>2</sup>C must be connected to a board that supports I<sup>2</sup>C and [has it enabled](/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#enabling-specific-communication-protocols-on-the-raspberry-pi).
{{% /alert %}}

## GPS

A global positioning system (GPS) is based on receiving signals from satellites in the earth’s orbit.
A GPS is useful for knowing where you are and how fast you’re going.
`Position`, `CompassHeading` and `LinearVelocity` data are provided by all GPS modules.
Fix and Correction data are available by using the sensor GetReadings method, which is available because GPSes wrap the sensor component.

{{% alert title="Info" color="tip" %}}
As with any Viam component configuration, configuring a movement sensor component requires a `name` of your choosing, a `type` ("movement_sensor"), and a `model` (see sections below for options).
Each GPS model must have either serial or I<sup>2</sup>C communication configured.
[Click here to jump to the communication config attribute information.](#connection-configuration)
Some models require other attributes, as detailed in their respective sections below.
{{% /alert %}}

We have integrated the following GPS modules into Viam’s RDK:

### GPS-NMEA

This GPS model uses communication standards set by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA).
The `gps-nmea` model can be connected via and send data through a serial connection to any device, or employ an I<sup>2</sup>C connection to a board:

#### GPS-NMEA over USB/Serial

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "depends_on": [],
    "model": "gps-nmea",
    "name": "UBLOX GPS",
    "type": "movement_sensor",
    "attributes": {
        "connection_type": "serial",
        "serial_attributes": {
            "serial_baud_rate": 115200,
            "serial_path": "/dev/serial/by-path/<device_ID>"
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the example `"serial_path"` filepath is specific to serial devices connected to linux systems.

#### GPS-NMEA over I<sup>2</sup>C

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "depends_on": [],
    "model": "gps-nmea",
    "name": "UBLOX GPS",
    "type": "movement_sensor",
    "attributes": {
        "board": "local",
        "connection_type": "I2C",
        "i2c_attributes": {
            "i2c_baud_rate": 115200,
            "i2c_addr": 111,
            "i2c_bus": "<name_of_bus_on_board>"
        }
    }
}
```

#### GPS-NMEA Attributes

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
---- | ---- | ------------- | -----
`board` | string | - | Required for NMEA over I<sup>2</sup>C; the board connected to the chip. Not required for serial communication.
`disable_nmea` | bool | false | Optional. If set to true, changes the NMEA message protocol to RTCM when using a chip as a base station.
`connection_type` | string | - | "I2C" or "serial", respectively

### GPS-RTK

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
The `gps-rtk` model is an experimental feature.
Stability is not guaranteed.
Breaking changes are likely to occur, and occur often.
{{% /alert %}}

This model uses real time kinematic positioning [RTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning).
`gps-rtk`, a module with a chip ([such as one of these from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/rtk)) capable of generating positional accuracy of 2cm.
The chip requires a correction source to get to the required positional accuracy.
Our `gps-rtk` model uses an over-the-internet correction source [NTRIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networked_Transport_of_RTCM_via_Internet_Protocol) and sends the data over serial or I<sup>2</sup>C.

As shown in the examples below, the `gps-rtk` model requires a `name`, `type` ("movement_sensor"), and `model` ("gps-rtk").
In the `attributes` section, it requires connection configuration (see ["Connection Configuration,"](#connection-configuration) below), `correction_source` ("ntrip"), and an `ntrip_attributes` struct containing these:

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
---- | ---- | ------------- | ----------
**Required:** | | |
`ntrip_addr` | string | - | The URL of the NTRIP server from which you get correction data. Connects to a base station (maintained by a third party) for RTK corrections.
`ntrip_username` | string | - | Username for the NTRIP server
`ntrip_password` | string | - | Password for the NTRIP server
 | | |
**Optional:** | | |
`ntrip_connect_attempts` | int | 10 | no | How many times to attempt connection before timing out
`ntrip_baud` | int | defaults to `serial_baud_rate` | no | Only necessary if you want NTRIP baud rate to be different from serial baud rate.
---

#### GPS-RTK with NTRIP over USB/Serial

Example config:

            "ntrip_username": "<username>"
        }
    }
}
```

            "ntrip_username": "<username>"
        }
    }
}
```

### RTK-Station

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
The `rtk-station` model is an experimental feature.
Stability is not guaranteed.
Breaking changes are likely to occur, and occur often.
{{% /alert %}}

The experimental `rtk-station` model allows you to configure your own correction source.
This does not provide any movement sensor data on its own, but can be linked to an RTK-ready GPS module on a moving robot and send that robot correction data over your own network, radio, or Bluetooth in areas where internet connectivity is limited, or where an NTRIP server is unavailable.
We have implemented this in a way that does not rely on an internet connection to get correction data for a moving GPS.

For all of the following RTK-station configurations, `children` is the list of one or more other GPS components that can take RTCM corrections.

#### RTK-Station using NTRIP

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "model": "rtk-station",
    "name": "my-rtk-station",
    "type": "movement_sensor",
    "children": [
        "gps1"
    ],
    "attributes": {
        "connection_type": "serial",
        "ntrip_attributes": {
            "ntrip_addr": "<NTRIP_address>",
            "ntrip_baud": 38400,
            "ntrip_password": "<password>",
            "ntrip_path": "",
            "ntrip_username": "<username>"
        },
        "correction_source": "ntrip"
    }
}
```

#### RTK-Station using I<sup>2</sup>C

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "model": "rtk-station",
    "name": "my-rtk-station",
    "type": "movement_sensor",
    "children": [
        "gps1"
    ],
    "attributes": {
        "board": "board",
        "connection_type": "serial",
        "i2c_attributes": {
            "i2c_baud_rate": 115200,
            "i2c_addr": 111,
            "i2c_bus": "<name_of_bus_on_board>",
       },
        "correction_source": "I2C",
        "loc_accuracy": 10,
        "svin": "time",
        "time_accuracy": 60
    }
}
```

#### RTK-Station using Serial/USB

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "children": [
        "gps1"
    ],
    "attributes": {
        "connection_type": "serial",
        "serial_attributes": {
            "serial_baud_rate": 115200,
            "serial_path": "/dev/serial/by-path/<device_ID>"
        },
        "correction_source": "serial"
    }
}
```

### Connection Configuration

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
This section applies to all GPS models.
{{% /alert %}}

Use `connection_type`(string) to specify "serial" or "I2C" connection in the main `attributes` config.
Then create a struct within `attributes` for either `serial_attributes` or `i2c_attributes`, respectively.

#### Serial Config Attributes

For a movement sensor communicating over serial, you'll need to include a `serial_attributes` field containing:

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
---- | ---- | ------------- | -----
`serial_path` | string | - | The name of the port through which the sensor communicates with the computer.
`serial_baud_rate` | int | 115200 | The rate at which data is sent from the sensor. Optional.
---

Serial communication uses a filepath instead of relying on any specific piece of board hardware, so no "board" attribute is needed when configuring a movement sensor with this communication method.

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "name": "<my-movement-sensor-name>",
    "type": "<TYPE>",
    "model": "<MODEL>",
    "attributes": {
        "<whatever other attributes>": "<example>",
        "connection_type": "serial",
        "serial_attributes": {
            "serial_baud_rate": 115200,
            "serial_path": "<PATH>"
        }
    }
}
```

#### I<sup>2</sup>C Config Attributes

For a movement sensor communicating over I<sup>2</sup>C, you'll need a `i2c_attributes` field containing:

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
---- | ---- | ------------- | -----
`i2c_bus` | string | - | The name of I<sup>2</sup>C bus wired to the sensor.
`i2c_addr` | int | - | The device's I<sup>2</sup>C address.
`i2c_baud_rate` | int | 115200 | The rate at which data is sent from the sensor. Optional.
---

You'll also need to configure the `board` attribute with the name of the board to which the I<sup>2</sup>C connection is being made.

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "name": "<my-movement-sensor-name>",
    "type": "<TYPE>",
    "model": "<MODEL>",
    "attributes": {
        "board": "<name of board, e.g. local>",
        "<whatever other attributes>": "<example>",
        "connection_type": "I2C",
        "i2c_attributes": {
            "i2c_addr": 111,
            "i2c_bus": "1"
        }
    }
}
```

## IMU

An inertial measurement unit (IMU) can provide `AngularVelocity`, `Orientation`, and `CompassHeading` methods out of the box (ordered from most common to least common).
Acceleration and Magnetometer data are available by using the Sensor `GetReadings` method, which IMUs wrap.
We have included IMUs from two manufacturers in our RDK.

### IMU Configuration

An IMU will be configured with type `movement sensor`.
Viam currently (14 December 2022) supports two IMU models, manufactured by WitMotion and VectorNav.
They are configured with model `imu-wit` or `imu-vectornav`, respectively.

### IMU-WIT

Example IMU-WIT config:

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "name": "myIMU",
    "type": "movement_sensor",
    "model": "imu-wit",
    "attributes": {
        "serial_path": "<PATH>",
        "serial_baud_rate": 115200
    },
    "depends_on": []
}
```

### IMU-VectorNav

Example IMU-VectorNav config:

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "name": "myIMU",
    "type": "movement_sensor",
    "model": "imu-vectornav",
    "attributes": {
        "board": "local",
        "spi": "1",
        "spi_baud_rate": 3800,
        "polling_freq_hz": 80,
        "chip_select_pin": "36"
  },
  "depends_on": []
}
```

#### IMU-VectorNav Attributes

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
`board` | string | - | The name of the board to which the device is wired
`spi` | string | The name of the SPI bus over which the device communicates with the board. On a Raspberry Pi, people often use the bus named "1."
`chip_select_pin` | string | - | The board pin (other than the SPI bus pins) connected to the IMU chip. Used to tell the chip whether the current SPI message is meant for it or for another device.
`spi_baud_rate` | int | 115200 | The rate at which data is sent from the IMU.
`polling_frequency_hz` | int |

## Accelerometer/Gyroscope

### ADXL345

The ADXL345 sensor manufactured by Analog Devices is a 3 axis accelerometer.
Calling `GetReadings` (a method supported by all [sensor components](/components/sensor/)) on it will yield linear acceleration data.

Configure this sensor with type `movement_sensor` and model `accel-adxl345` as well as a board component with an I<sup>2</sup>C bus:

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "local",
      "type": "board",
      "model": "pi",
      "attributes": {
        "i2cs": [
          {
            "name": "default_i2c_bus",
            "bus": "1"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "my-adxl",
      "type": "movement_sensor",
      "model": "accel-adxl345",
      "attributes": {
        "board": "local",
        "i2c_bus": "default_i2c_bus",
        "use_alternate_i2c_address": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ADXL1345 Attributes

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
`board` | string | - | The name of the board to which the device is wired.
`use_alt_i2c_address` | bool | false | Depends on whether you wire SDO low (leaving the default address of 0x53) or high (making the address 0x1D). If high, set true. If low, set false or omit the attribute.
`i2c_bus` | string | - | The name of the I<sup>2</sup>C bus through which the device communicates with the SBC. Note that this must match the name you gave the I<sup>2</sup>C bus you configured in the board component.

### MPU6050

The [MPU6050 sensor manufactured by TDK InvenSense](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/mpu-6050/) is a combination accelerometer and gyroscope.
It supplies angular velocity data about the three axes, supporting the `AngularVelocity` method.
It also supplies linear acceleration data in three directions.
The linear acceleration data (as well as all the other data from the MPU6050) can be accessed using the `GetReadings` method from the more general [sensor component](/components/sensor/), which movement sensors wrap.
Unlike the IMUs listed above, it does not contain magnetometers or provide orientation data.

Configuration of this sensor requires configuring a movement sensor component with model `gyro-mpu6050` as well as a board component with an I<sup>2</sup>C bus:

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "components": [
        {
            "name": "local",
            "type": "board",
            "model": "pi",
            "attributes": {
                  "i2cs": [
                    {
                    "name": "default_i2c_bus",
                    "bus": "1"
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "my_accelgyro",
            "type": "movement_sensor",
            "model": "gyro-mpu6050",
            "depends_on": [],
            "attributes": {
                "use_alt_i2c_address": true,
                "i2c_bus": "default_i2c_bus",
                "board": "local"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### MPU6050 Attributes

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
`board` | string | - | The name of the board to which the device is wired.
`use_alt_i2c_address` | bool | false | Depends on whether you wire AD0 low (leaving the default address of 0x68) or high (making the address 0x69). If high, set true. If low, set false or omit the attribute.
`i2c_bus` | string | - | The name of the I<sup>2</sup>C bus through which the device communicates with the SBC. Note that this must match the name you gave the I<sup>2</sup>C bus you configured in the board component.

## Cameramono

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
The `cameramono` model is an experimental feature.
Stability is not guaranteed.
Breaking changes are likely to occur, and occur often.
{{% /alert %}}

We have integrated an experimental package that uses a visual odometry algorithm with dead reckoning to track the Position, Orientation, LinearVelocity and AngularVelocity of the camera’s frame.
The `cameramono` model can use any single camera with this algorithm.

In a Viam configuration file, a camera used as a movement sensor will require a [`camera` type component](/components/camera/) and then a `movementsensor` type component that depends on the `camera` component, and a `motion_estimation_config` based on the camera properties.

```json-viam {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "components": [
        {
            "attributes": {},
            "depends_on": [],
            "model": "pi",
            "name": "example-board",
            "type": "board"
        },
        {
            "name": "myCamera",
            "type": "camera",
            "model": "webcam",
            "attributes": {},
            "depends_on": []
        },
        {
            "name": "movementCamera",
            "type": "movementsensor",
            "model": "cameramono",
            "attributes": {
                "camera": "myCamera",
                "motion_config": "see_vision_documentation"
                },
            "depends_on": [
            "myCamera"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
