The base component provides an API for moving all configured components attached to a mobile robot platform as a whole without needing to send commands to individual components.

If you have a mobile robot, use a base component to coordinate the motion of its motor components.

## Available models

To use a rover or other base, you need to add it to your machine's configuration.

Most mobile robots with a base need at least the following hardware:

- A [board](/components/board/).
- Some sort of actuators to move the base.
  Usually [motors](/components/motor/) attached to wheels or propellers.
- A power supply for the board.
- A power supply for the actuators.
- Some sort of chassis to hold everything together.

Go to your machine's **CONFIGURE** page, and add a model that supports your base.

The following list shows the available base models.
For additional configuration information, click on the model name:

You can also use the base component with the following services:

- [Navigation service](/services/navigation/): to navigate with GPS
- [SLAM service](/services/slam/): for mapping
