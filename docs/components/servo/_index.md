The servo component supports ["RC" or "hobby" servo motors](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/rc-servos).
These are small motors with built-in potentiometer position sensors, enabling you to control the angular position of the servo precisely.

As servos can use a lot of power, drawing voltage away from a [board](/components/board/), you should power your servo with its own power supply in most cases.
The following shows an example wiring diagram for a hobby servo wired to a [`pi` board](/components/board/pi/):

![A diagram showing the signal wire of a servo connected to pin 16 on a Raspberry Pi. The servo's power wires are connected to a 4.8V power supply.](/components/servo/servo-wiring.png)

The colors of the servo wires in this diagram may not match your servo.
Refer to your servo's data sheet for wiring specifications.

Most machines with a servo need at least the following hardware:

- A [board component](/components/board/) that can run `viam-server`
- A servo
- A power supply for the board
- A power supply for the servo

The Viam servo component supports [hobby servos](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/rc-servos).

If your motor is coupled with an [encoder](/components/encoder/), not a potentiometer, for position feedback, you should not configure it as a servo.
Check your device's data sheet and configure that type of servo as an [encoded motor](/components/motor/encoded-motor/).

## Available models

To use your servo component, check whether one of the following models supports it.

For configuration information, click on the model name:

## Control your servo with Viam's client SDK libraries

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your machine, go to your machine's page on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

When executed, this sample code will create a connection to your machine as a client.
Then control your machine programmatically by adding API method calls as shown in the following examples.

These examples assume you have a servo called `"my_servo"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your servo has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Be sure to import the servo package for the SDK you are using:

```python
from viam.components.servo import Servo
```

{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```go

  "go.viam.com/rdk/components/servo"
)
```
