A _sensor_ is a device that can measure information about the outside world.
Add a sensor component to your machine to send the information the sensor measures to the computer controlling the machine.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

Viam has three additional component types defined separately from _sensor_ that you can use to implement sensors with specific functions:

1. [Movement sensors](/components/movement-sensor/) for Global Positioning System (GPS) units, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and other sensors that detect position, velocity, and acceleration.
2. [Power sensors](/components/power-sensor/) for sensors that can detect voltage, current, and power consumption of connected hardware.
3. [Encoders](/components/encoder/) for sensors that can detect speed and direction of rotation of a motor or a joint.

Most machines with a sensor need at least the following hardware:

- A [board](/components/board/)
- Depending on your sensor's output type (analog or digital), an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) may be necessary to allow the sensor to communicate with the board

## Control your sensor with Viam's client SDK libraries

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your machine, go to your machine's page on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code generated.

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

When executed, this sample code will create a connection to your machine as a client.
Then control your machine programmatically by adding API method calls as shown in the following examples.

These examples assume you have a sensor called `"my_sensor"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your sensor has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Be sure to import the sensor package for the SDK you are using:
