A _component_ represents a physical piece of electrical or electromechanical hardware in a machine.

Viam provides built-in support for the following component types.
You can also add support for additional component types using {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resources" >}}.

If you are connecting components to a microcontroller instead of a 64-bit single-board computer, find component configuration information in the [micro-RDK documentation](/build/micro-rdk/).
