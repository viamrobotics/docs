Before you can program a robot, you must configure it.

A robot's configuration tells the code running the robot what _resources_ (hardware _components_ and software _services_) it has access to, as well as any relevant parameters for those resources.

To start configuring, go to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com), create a new robot and follow the steps on your new robot’s **Setup** tab.

The setup steps copy your robots credentials to your robot and store them at <file>/etc/viam.json</file>.
The credentials look like this:

```json
{
  "cloud": {
    "app_address": "https://app.viam.com:123",
    "id": "123456ab-a1b2-12a3-a123-1a2b345cdefg6",
    "secret": "LOCATION SECRET FROM THE VIAM APP"
  }
}
```

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

When you turn on your robot, `viam-server` starts up and, by default, it uses the credentials in its local <file>/etc/viam.json</file> to fetch its full config from the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Once the robot has a configuration, it caches it locally and can use the configuration for up to 60 days.
The robot checks for new configurations every 15 seconds and changes its configuration automatically when a new configuration is available.
All communication happens securely over HTTPS using secret tokens that are in a robot's configuration.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
You can also store your config file in a custom location if desired. See [Run `viam-server`](/get-started/installation/manage/#run-viam-server) for more information.
{{< /alert >}}

After you have completed the setup steps and successfully connected to your robot, go to the **Config** tab to start adding to the configuration.

{{% alert title="Info" color="info" %}}

Your robot does not need to stay connected to the Viam app after it has obtained its configuration file.
The configuration is cached locally.
If your robot will never connect to the internet, you can also create a [local configuration file](/reference/internals/local-configuration-file/) on the robot itself.
{{% /alert %}}

## The Config tab

The **Config** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) is the place to configure everything about your robot.

You can use the mode selector to switch between **Builder** and **Raw JSON**:

- **Builder** mode provides a graphical interface for configuring your robot resources.
- **Raw JSON** mode provides a text editing field where you can write and edit the config manually.

![The CONFIG tab of the Viam app with a box highlighting the CONFIG tab and the Mode selector (where you can select Builder or Raw JSON).](/build/configure/config-tab.png)

Regardless of the mode you choose, Viam stores the configuration file in [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

{{< alert title="Simultaneous config edits" color="caution" >}}
If you edit a config while someone else edits the same config, the person who saves last will overwrite any prior changes that aren't reflected in the new config.

Before editing a config, we recommend you refresh the page to ensure you have all the latest changes.
{{< /alert >}}

If you add components in **Builder** mode and click **Save Config** at the bottom of the screen, you can switch to **Raw JSON** and see the JSON that has been generated by the builder.

{{% /expand %}}

The **Config** tab has subtabs for each section of your robot's config:

- [Components](#components): Components are the hardware of your robot.
- [Services](#services): Services are the software that runs on your robot.
- [Modules](#modules): {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="Modules" >}} provide {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resources" >}}, which are a way to add resource types or models that are not built into Viam.
- [Remotes](#remotes): Remotes are a way to connect two separate robots so one can access the resources of the other.
- [Processes](#processes): Processes automatically run specified scripts when the robot boots.
- [Fragments](#fragments): Fragments are a way of sharing and managing identical configuration files (or parts of config files) across multiple robots.
- [Auth/Network](#authnetwork): The auth and network section allows you to configure robot-level API keys and set a bind address for `viam-server`.
- [Frames](#frame-system): Frames hold reference frame information for the relative position of components in space.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

Simple robots often use only a few components (and perhaps services).
Depending on your robot, you may not need to configure any modules, remotes, processes, fragments or frames.

{{% /alert %}}

## Components

Components represent the pieces of hardware on your robot that you want to control with Viam.

You must configure each component with a type, a model, a name, attributes, and dependencies:

- `type`: The broad component category, such as `motor`, `arm` or `camera`.
  Components of a given type have a common API.

- `model`: Indicates the more specific category of hardware.
  Components of the same model are supported using the same low-level code.

- `name`: Serves as an identifier when accessing the resource from your code, as well as when configuring other resources that are dependent on that resource.
  You can choose any unique name for a component.

- `attributes`: A struct to define things like how the component is wired to the robot, its dimensions, and other specifications; attributes vary widely between models.
  See the [component documentation](/build/configure/components/) for a given component type and model for more details.

  {{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

  Some optional attributes have default values.
  If you omit these attributes from your config, or if you include them but leave their values empty, `viam-server` will apply these default values at runtime, even though they are not reflected in the configuration file.

  {{% /alert %}}

- `depends_on`: Any components that a given component relies upon, and that must be initialized on boot before this component is initialized.
  Many built-in components have convenient implicit dependencies, in which case `depends_on` can be left blank.
  For example, a [`gpio` motor](/build/configure/components/motor/gpio/) depends on the `board` to which it is wired, but it has a dedicated `board` attribute and `viam-server` will automatically initialize that board before it looks for the motor.

If you are configuring several similar components, you can use the **Duplicate component** button in the upper-right of a component's configuration pane to create a new identical component beneath your existing one.
Be sure to edit the duplicated component to change any parameters that are unique to the new component, such as its name and pins.

To delete a component, click the trash can icon in the upper-right of the component configuration pane.

For specific information on how to configure each supported component type, see the [components documentation](/build/configure/components/).

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

When you configure a component on the **Config** tab, it will also appear on the **Control** tab which gives you an interface to test and interact with it.
Meanwhile the **Code sample** tab will also update to include code for some basic interaction with that component using the Viam [SDKs](/build/program/apis/).

{{<gif webm_src="/manage/control.webm" mp4_src="/manage/control.mp4" alt="Using the control tab">}}

{{% /alert %}}

## Services

[Services](/build/configure/services/) are built-in software packages that make it easier to add complex capabilities such as motion planning or object detection to your robot.

For services, the `type` specifies which of the Viam services you want to use on your robot, such as the vision service or the motion service.

The `name` serves as an identifier when accessing the resource from your code, as well as when configuring other resources that are dependent on that resource.
You can choose any unique name for a service.

The other aspects of configuring a service are highly specific to the type of service.
See the [services documentation](/build/configure/services/) for more information.

## Modules

[Modular resources](/registry/) are a way to add resource types or models that are not built into Viam.

To add a modular resource as a component or service of your robot, configure a module per the [modular resource documentation](/registry/).

## Remotes

Configuring a remote is a way to connect two separate robots so one can access the resources of the other.
Find more information in our [remotes documentation](/build/configure/parts-and-remotes/).

## Processes

To automatically run a specified script when the robot boots, configure a _process_.

Start by giving the process a **Name** (`id` in raw JSON) (an identifier of your choice) and clicking **Create Process**.

Then fill in the following fields:

- **Executable** (`name`): The command you want to execute when your robot connects to the server.
- **Arguments** (`args`): Optional arguments to follow the command.
- **Working Directory** (`cwd`): Where you want the process to execute.
  An optional setting that defaults to the directory where `viam-server` executes.

You can also toggle whether you want errors and other messages to be logged, and whether to execute the command just once or keep running the process indefinitely.
In raw JSON, these options are represented by `log` (bool) and `one_shot` (bool), respectively.

{{% expand "Click to see an example of a configured process." %}}

The following configuration executes the command `python3 my_cool_script.py` in your <file>/home/myName/project/</file> directory every time your robot boots, and keeps it executing indefinitely.

![The PROCESSES subtab of the CONFIG tab with a process called run-my-code configured. The executable is python3, the argument is my_cool_script.py, and the working directory is /home/myName/project. Logging is turned on and execute once is turned off.](/build/configure/process-fancy.png)

The corresponding raw JSON looks like this:

```json
"processes": [
    {
      "id": "run-my-code",
      "log": true,
      "name": "python3",
      "args": [
        "my_cool_script.py"
      ],
      "cwd": "/home/myName/project/"
    }
  ]
```

## Fragments

Fragments are a way of sharing and managing identical {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resource" >}} configuration files across multiple robots.
For example, if you have multiple robots with the same hardware, wired the same way, you can create and share a fragment and add it to any number of robots.
When changes are made to the fragment, those changes are automatically carried to all robots that include the fragment in their config.

### Create a fragment

To create your own private fragment, go to [app.viam.com/fragments](https://app.viam.com/fragments) or click on **Fragments** in the left navigation bar on the [FLEET page](https://app.viam.com/robots).

1. Enter a name for your new fragment and click **Add fragment**.
2. Add the JSON configuration in the config field.
3. Click **SAVE FRAGMENT**.

![Fragment creation view](/manage/fragment-view.png)

### Add a fragment to a robot

You can add a fragment to a robot's config and also add other configuration outside the fragment.
For example, if you have multiple identical rovers but one has an arm attached, you can add the rover configuration fragment (including the motors and base components), and then configure the arm on just that one rover.

To add a fragment to a robot:

- Go to the **Fragments** subtab of your robot's **Config** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
- Look through the list of available fragments and click **Add** next to any fragments you want to add to your robot.
- Click **Save Config** at the bottom of the screen.

![The fragments subtab](/manage/fragments-tab.png)

The components and services included in the fragment appear inside a read-only fragment section in the **Components** and **Services** subtabs.

![A fragment in the components subtab](/manage/fragment-components.png)

In the `Raw JSON` configuration, you will see the fragment ID in the `fragments` section:

```json
{
  "components": [],
  "fragments": ["3e8e0e1c-f515-4eac-8307-b6c9de7cfb84"]
}
```

For an example of adding a fragment to a robot, see the [Viam Rover fragment tutorial](/get-started/try-viam/rover-resources/rover-tutorial-fragments/).

### Modify the config of a robot that uses a fragment

When you modify a fragment, those changes are pushed to all robots that use that fragment.
If you need to modify the config of just one robot that uses a fragment you can do the following:

1. Go to the **Fragments** subtab of the **Config** tab.
2. Click **Remove** next to the fragment.
3. Select and copy the contents of the fragment in the box on the right side of the **Fragments** subtab.
4. Toggle to **Raw JSON** mode.
5. Paste the raw fragment contents into the **Raw JSON** config field.
6. Click **Save config**.
7. Now, you can edit the config either in **Raw JSON** mode or in **Builder** mode.

## Auth/network

The auth section allows you to configure robot-level API keys for connecting over LAN.

The network section allows you to set the address `viam-server` binds to for accepting connections.
By default, `viam-server` binds to `0.0.0.0:8080` when managed by the Viam app or when authentication and TLS are enabled.

## Frame system

The frame system holds reference frame information for the relative position of components in space.

Configure a frame for a given component on its panel on the **Components** tab, then switch to the **Frame System** tab to visualize the relative positions.
Find more information in the [frame system documentation](/mobility/frame-system/).

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, here are some things to try:

- Check the [**Logs** tab](/fleet/machines/#logs) to view log messages and errors from `viam-server`.
  You can also [access the local log file](/get-started/installation/manage/#view-viam-server-logs) on your robot if needed.
- Make sure all configured components are actually saved to your config.
  If they aren't, you will see an **Unsaved Changes** note next to the **Save Config** button at the bottom of the config screen.
- Try restarting `viam-server` by clicking **Restart** in the upper right corner of the app.
  It takes a few minutes for the server to shut down and restart.
- Make sure the issue is not hardware related.
  Some things to check are that the robot has adequate power, all wires are properly connected, and no chips or other hardware components are shorted or overheated.
- See [Troubleshooting](/reference/appendix/troubleshooting/) for additional troubleshooting steps.

## Local Setup

Configuring `viam-server` with the Viam app allows you to make use of the cloud features of Viam:

- [Fleet Management](/fleet/)
- [Data Management](/data/)
- [Machine Learning](/ml/)

However, if you are configuring a robot that can never connect to the internet, you can create a [local configuration file](/reference/internals/local-configuration-file/) on your robot.
A locally-configured robot will not be able to access Viam's cloud features.

## Next Steps

After configuring your robot, you can use the [Viam SDKs](/build/program/apis/) to program and control your robot.

If you want to try configuring a robot but don't have any hardware on hand, try the [Build a Mock Robot](/tutorials/configure/build-a-mock-robot/) tutorial.
