An encoder is a special type of sensor that measures rotation of a motor or joint.
For more information and models supported by the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="rdk" text="RDK" >}}, see [Encoder Component](/components/encoder/).

## Supported models

For configuration information, click on one of the supported encoder model names:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Model | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [`incremental`](incremental/) | A two phase encoder, which can measure the speed and direction of rotation in relation to a given reference point |
| [`single`](single/) | A single pin "pulse output" encoder which returns its relative position but no direction |

## API

The micro-RDK [encoder API](/components/encoder/#api) supports only the following supported client SDK API methods, which operate the same ways as those in the full-featured RDK:

- [`ResetPosition()`](/components/encoder/#resetposition)
- [`GetPosition()`](/components/encoder/#getposition)
- [`GetProperties()`](/components/encoder/#getproperties)
- [`DoCommand()`](/components/encoder/#docommand)
