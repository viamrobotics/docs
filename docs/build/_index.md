Viam uses a composable system of building blocks called {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}} ([components](/components/) and [services](/services/)) so you can add the hardware and software functionality you need to your robot.

First [install `viam-server`](/get-started/installation/).
Then pull together whichever Viam resources you like by configuring your robot.
Finally, program your robot with an SDK in your preferred coding language.
