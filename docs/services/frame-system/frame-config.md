Imagine a robotic [arm](/components/arm/) is attached to a table.

Consider one corner of the table the arm is attached to to be the origin of the `world`, `(0, 0, 0)`.
Measure from that point to the base of the arm to get the `translation` coordinates.

- Suppose the arm is offset from the corner by 100mm in the positive X direction, and 250mm in the negative Y direction.
- Supply this `translation` when configuring the arm component's `frame` information.
- Leave `parent` and `orientation` at their default values.

To complete the frame configuration for your robot following this example, navigate to the **Config** tab on your robot's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), select the **Builder** mode, scroll to `myArm`'s card, and click **Add Frame**:

![frame card example for this configuration](/services/frame-system/frame_card_static.png)

Select the `parent` frame as `world` and fill in the coordinates for `translation` (*mm*) and `orientation` (*deg*) according to the position and orientation of the arm in relation to the `world` frame's origin.

| Parameter | Inclusion | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| `Parent`  | **Required** | Default: `world`. The name of the reference frame you want to act as the parent of this frame. |
| `Translation` | **Required** | Default: `(0, 0, 0)`. The coordinates that the origin of this component's reference frame has within its parent reference frame. <br> Units: *mm*. |
| `Orientation`  | **Required** | Default: `(0, 0, 1), 0`. The [orientation vector](/internals/orientation-vector/) that yields the axes of the component's reference frame when applied as a rotation to the axes of the parent reference frame. <br> Types: `Orientation Vector Degrees`, `Orientation Vector Radians`, and `Quaternion`. |
| `Geometry`  | Optional | Default: `none`. Collision geometries for defining bounds in the environment of the robot. <br> Types: `Sphere`, `Box`, and `Capsule`. |

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

Note: `myArm` uses the default `orientation` from the `world` origin.

You do not have to explicitly configure this on your robot, as it is the default.
It is included as part of this example for illustrative purposes.
