Robot Service constitutes a minimal set of APIs that most robots (Viam Server, [Viam Python SDK](https://python.viam.dev/) and various SDKs) should support.
Users will likely use the Robot Service as an entrypoint to interact with Viam robots and provide a way to get updates from the robot as a whole.

The below is a current list of interfaces provided by the Robot Service.

<table>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BlockForOperation</td>
        <td>The request will only return once the specified operation is complete.
        Useful if a process needs to work until another is completed.
        Requires the <strong>Operations ID</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CancelOperation</td>
        <td>Cancels a specified operation.
        Requires the <strong>Operations ID</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>DiscoverComponents</td>
        <td>Returns a best-effort configuration for a resource subtype and model that can be discovered on the robot (like a webcam on a Pi).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>FrameSystemConfig</td>
        <td>Returns the frame system configuration of the robot.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>GetOperations</td>
        <td>Returns all running operations initiated over gRPC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC" target="_blank">Google Remote Procedure Call</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>GetStatus</td>
        <td>Returns the status for the resources queried for, all resources if none specified.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ResourceNames</td>
        <td>Returns the list of all resources currently available on the robot.
        This includes remote resources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ResourceRPCSubtypes</td>
        <td>Returns all resource subtypes available on the robot (this is more of an advance feature, the RDK uses it for user defined resources)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>StopAll</td>
        <td>Cancels all ongoing operations and then attempts to stop all resources that can be stopped.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>StreamStatus</td>
        <td>Streams the status for the resources queried for, all resources if none specified.
        The interval at which the stream refreshes can also be specified.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>TransformPose</td>
        <td>Transforms the pose in frame into a frame within the robot’s frame system.</td>
    </tr>

## Operation and Operation IDs

**Operation IDs** are how Viam tracks in-flight operations/robot commands over gRPC network requests.

The robot creates a unique **Operation ID** for every request (operation).
This ID expires once the request is completed.
Each new gRPC request creates a new **Operation ID**, even if it was created from a pre-existing operation.

Users can cancel an operation by passing in its **Operation ID,** and can also block a specific operation, again, by specifying its **Operation ID**, until that operation is complete.

For example, consider two _connected_ robots. Robot "A," with an attached base and navigation service and robot "B," operating remotely with an attached GPS.
A client’s request to the navigation service to move "A" creates a new **Operation ID**.

The request to the attached base is a local request (that is, a non-gRPC request) between the navigation service and its base and does not create a new **Operation ID**.
However, the navigation service request to the GPS is through gRPC, which spawns a new operation and thus another **Operation ID**.

Canceling the initial **Operation ID** cancels the first operation on the navigation service, but that does not cancel the second operation (obtaining the location from the remote GPS).
