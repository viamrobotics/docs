The navigation service is the stateful definition of Viam's [motion service](/services/motion/).
It uses GPS to autonomously navigate a rover [base](/components/base/) to user-defined waypoints.

Configure your base with a navigation service, add waypoints, and set the mode of the service to [**Waypoint**](/appendix/apis/services/navigation/#setmode) to move your rover along a defined path at your desired motion configuration.

## Requirements

You must configure a [base](/components/base/) with [movement sensors](/components/movement-sensor/) as part of your machine to configure a navigation service.

To use the navigation service, configure a stack of movement sensors that implement the following methods in their {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models'" >}} implementations of the [movement sensor API](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#api):

- [`GetPosition()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getposition)
- [`GetCompassHeading()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getcompassheading)
- [`GetProperties()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getproperties)

The base should implement the following:

- [`SetVelocity()`](/appendix/apis/components/base/#setvelocity)
- [`GetGeometries()`](/appendix/apis/components/base/#getgeometries)
- [`GetProperties()`](/appendix/apis/components/base/#getproperties)

See [navigation concepts](#navigation-concepts) for more info on how to implement and use movement sensors taking these measurements.

## Configuration

First, make sure your base is physically assembled and powered on.
Then, configure the service:

### Configure and calibrate the frame system service for GPS navigation

{{% alert title="Info" color="info" %}}

The [frame system service](/services/frame-system/) is an internally managed and mostly static system for storing the reference frame of each component of a machine within a coordinate system configured by the user.

It stores the required contextual information for Viam's services like [Motion](/services/motion/) and [Vision](/services/vision/) to use the position and orientation readings returned by components like [movement sensors](/components/movement-sensor/).

{{% /alert %}}

To make sure your rover base's autonomous GPS navigation with the navigation service is accurate, configure and calibrate the frame system service for the components of your machine.

#### Configure

Add a [nested reference frame](/services/frame-system/nested-frame-config/) configuration to your rover [base](/components/base/) and [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/):

- Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of your machine's page in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) and select the **Frame** mode.
- From the left-hand menu, select your base.
- Since you haven't adjusted any parameters yet, the default reference frame will be shown for your base:

  {{<imgproc src="/services/navigation/select-base-frame.png" resize="300x" style="width: 500px" alt="Frame card for a base with the default reference frame settings">}}

- Keep the `parent` frame as `world`.
  Select the **Geometry** dropdown menu.
- Configure a **Geometry** for the base that reflects its physical dimensions.
  Measure the physical dimensions of your base and use them to configure the size of your geometry.
  Units are in _mm_.

  For example, you would configure a box-shaped base with dimensions of 100mm x 100mm x 100mm (l x h x w) as follows:

  {{<imgproc src="/services/navigation/configure-base-geometry.png" resize="300x" style="width: 500px" alt="The frame card for the base in the Viam app config builder.">}}

- Next, select your movement sensor from the left-hand menu. Click on the **Parent** menu and select your base component.
- Give the movement sensor a **Translation** that reflects where it is mounted on your base, measuring the coordinates with respect to the origin of the base.
  In other words, designate the base origin as `(0,0,0)` and measure the distance between that and the origin of the sensor to obtain the coordinates.

  For example, you would configure a movement sensor mounted 200mm on top of your base as follows:

  {{<imgproc src="/services/navigation/full-frame-movement-sensor-ui.png" resize="300x" style="width: 500px" alt="The frame card for the movement sensor in the Viam app config builder.">}}

You can also adjust the **Orientation** and **Geometry** of your movement sensor or base, if necessary.
See [the frame system service](/services/frame-system/#configuration) for instructions.

#### Calibrate

Then, to calibrate your frame system for the most accurate autonomous GPS navigation with the navigation service:

- After configuring your machine, navigate to the **CONTROL** tab and select the card matching the name of your movement sensor.
- Monitor the readings displayed on the card, and verify that the compass or orientation readings from the movement sensor report `0` when the base is facing north.
- If you cannot verify this:
  - Navigate back to your machine's **CONFIGURE** tab and **Frame** subtab.
    Scroll to the card with the name of your movement sensor.
    Adjust the **Orientation** of the frame to compensate for the mismatch.
  - Navigate back to the movement sensor card on your **CONTROL** page, and confirm that the compass or orientation readings from the movement sensor now report `0` when the base is facing north, confirming that you've successfully calibrated your machine to be oriented accurately within the frame system.
  - If you cannot verify this, repeat as necessary.

## API

The [navigation service API](/appendix/apis/services/navigation/) supports the following methods:

{{< readfile "/static/include/services/apis/generated/navigation-table.md" >}}

## Control tab usage

After configuring the navigation service for your machine, navigate to the **CONTROL** tab of the machine's page in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) and expand the card matching the name of your service to use an interface for rover navigation.

Here, you can toggle the mode of the service between **Manual** and **Waypoint** to start and stop navigation, add waypoints and obstacles, and view the position of your rover base on a map:

![An example control interface for a navigation service in the Viam app Control Tab.](/services/navigation/navigation-control-card.png)

## Navigation concepts

The following concepts are important to understand when utilizing the navigation service.
Each concept is a type of relative or absolute measurement, taken by a [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/), which can then be used by your machine to navigate across space.

Here's how to use the following types of measurements:

- [Compass Heading](/services/navigation/#compass-heading)
- [Orientation](/services/navigation/#orientation)
- [Angular Velocity](/services/navigation/#angular-velocity)
- [Position](/services/navigation/#position)
- [Linear Acceleration](/services/navigation/#linear-acceleration)
- [Linear Velocity](/services/navigation/#linear-velocity)

### Compass heading

The following {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models" >}} of [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/) take compass heading measurements:

- [gps-nmea](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/) - some GPS hardware only report heading while moving.
- [gps-nmea-rtk-pmtk](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/) - some GPS hardware only report heading while moving.
- [gps-nmea-rtk-serial](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/) - some GPS hardware only report heading while moving.
- [imu-wit](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)
- [imu-wit-hwt905](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)

An example of a `CompassHeading` reading:

```go
// heading is a float64 between 0-360
heading, err := gps.CompassHeading(context.Background(), nil)
```

Use compass heading readings to determine the _bearing_ of your machine, or, the [cardinal direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction) that your machine is facing.

To read compass headings, [configure a capable movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/#configuration) on your machine.
Then use the movement sensor API's [`GetCompassHeading()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getcompassheading) method to get readings from the sensor.

### Orientation

The following {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models" >}} of [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/) take orientation measurements:

- [imu-wit](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)
- [imu-wit-hwt905](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)
- [wheeled-odometry](/components/movement-sensor/wheeled-odometry/)

An example of an `Orientation` reading:

```go
// orientation is a OrientationVector struct with OX, OY, OZ denoting the coordinates of the vector and rotation about z-axis, Theta
orientation, err := imuwit.Orientation(context.Background(), nil)
```

Use orientation readings to determine the orientation of an object in 3D space as an [_orientation vector_](/internals/orientation-vector/).
An orientation vector indicates how it is rotated relative to an origin coordinate system around the x, y, and z axes.
You can choose the origin reference frame by configuring it using Viam's [frame system](/services/frame-system/).
The `GetOrientation` readings will report orientations relative to that initial frame.

To read orientation, first [configure a capable movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/#configuration) on your machine.
Additionally, follow [these instructions](/services/frame-system/#configuration) to configure the geometries of each component of your machine within the [frame system](/services/frame-system/).
Then use the movement sensor API's [`GetOrientation()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getorientation) method to get orientation readings.

### Angular velocity

The following {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models" >}} of the [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/) component take angular velocity measurements:

- [imu-wit](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)
- [imu-wit-hwt905](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)
- [wheeled-odometry](/components/movement-sensor/wheeled-odometry/)
- [gyro-mpu6050](https://github.com/viam-modules/tdk-invensense/)

An example of an `AngularVelocity` reading:

```go
// angularVelocity is an AngularVelocity r3 Vector with X, Y, and Z magnitudes
angularVelocity, err := imu.AngularVelocity(context.Background(), nil)
```

Use angular velocity readings to determine the speed and direction at which your machine is rotating.

To get an angular velocity reading, first [configure a capable movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/#configuration) on your machine.
Then use the movement sensor API's [`GetAngularVelocity()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getangularvelocity) method to get angular velocity readings from the sensor.

### Position

The following {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models" >}} of the [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/) component take position measurements:

- [gps-nmea](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/)
- [gps-nmea-rtk-pmtk](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/)
- [gps-nmea-rtk-serial](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/)
- [wheeled-odometry](/components/movement-sensor/wheeled-odometry/)

An example of a `Position` reading:

```go
// position is a geo.Point consisting  of Lat and Long: -73.98 and an altitude in float64
position, altitude, err := imu.Position(context.Background(), nil)
```

Use position readings to determine the GPS coordinates of an object in 3D space or its position in the geographic coordinate system [(GCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system).
These position readings reflect the _absolute_ position of components.

To get a position, [configure a capable movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/#configuration) on your machine.
Then use the movement sensor API's [`GetPosition()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getposition) method to get position readings from the sensor.

### Linear velocity

The following {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models" >}} of [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/) take linear velocity measurements:

- [gps-nmea](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/)
- [gps-nmea-rtk-pmtk](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/)
- [gps-nmea-rtk-serial](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps/)
- [wheeled-odometry](/components/movement-sensor/wheeled-odometry/) (provides a relative estimate only based on where the base component has started)

An example of a `LinearVelocity` reading:

```go
// linearVelocity is an r3.Vector with X, Y, and Z magnitudes
linearVelocity, err := imu.LinearVelocity(context.Background(), nil)
```

Use linear velocity readings to determine the speed at which your machine is moving through space.

To get linear velocity, [configure a capable movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/#configuration) on your machine.
Then use the movement sensor API's [`GetLinearVelocity()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getlinearvelocity) method to get linear velocity readings from the sensor.

### Linear acceleration

The following {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models" >}} of [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/) take linear acceleration measurements:

- [accel-adxl345](https://github.com/viam-modules/analog-devices/)
- [imu-wit](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)
- [imu-wit-hwt905](https://github.com/viam-modules/wit-motion/)
- [gyro-mpu6050](https://github.com/viam-modules/tdk-invensense/)

An example of a `LinearAcceleration` reading:

```go
// linearAcceleration is an r3.Vector with X, Y, and Z magnitudes
linearAcceleration, err := imu.LinearAcceleration(context.Background(), nil)
```

You can use linear acceleration readings to determine the rate of change of the [linear velocity](/services/navigation/#linear-velocity) of your machine, or, the acceleration at which your machine is moving through space.

To get linear acceleration, [configure a capable movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/#configuration) on your machine.
Then use the movement sensor API's [`GetLinearAcceleration()`](/appendix/apis/components/movement-sensor/#getlinearacceleration) method to get linear acceleration readings from the sensor.
