# SLAM Service

SLAM, which stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, is an important area of ongoing research in robotics, particularly for mobile applications such as drones, boats, and rovers. At Viam, we want to offer our users an easy-to-use, intuitive method for interfacing with various cutting edge SLAM algorithms that may be useful in their mission.

As of 01 June 2022, we support the following SLAM libraries:

-   [ORBSLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3)


# Current Architecture

The SLAM service in rdk (located in /rdk/service/slam) is a wrapper for the C++ SLAM libraries mentioned above. It has three roles, interface with an executable C++ binary of the chosen library, start up a data process (if desired), and to pass GRPC requests/responses between servers.

## **Interfacing with the C++ Binary**

(TALK HERE ABOUT PARSING CONFIG THEN PACKAGING UP ARGUMENTS TO BE
FORWARDED AND CALLING SLAM PROCESS)

(ALSO MENTION SLAMLibraries)

## **GRPC Forwarding**

In order to receive pose and map updates from the slam algorithm, the slam service creates an internal client to communicate with the server in the algorithm. This internal client is then used when handling requests for the server in rdk. To do this, the slam service will pass in a desired port as an argument to the algorithm for the algorithm's server. There are two methods to define a port, the first being to specify the port within the config. If no port is specified, then rdk will find an open port to bind the server to.

# **RDK Config**

````JSON
"services": [
  {
    "attributes": {
      "algorithm": "cartographer",
      "data_dir": "<path_to_folder>",
      "sensors": ["rplidar"],
      "config_params": {
        "mode": "2d"
      },
      "map_rate_sec": 60,
      "data_rate_ms": 200,
      "input_file_pattern": "1:1000:1"
    },
    "name": "test",
    "type": "slam"
  }
]
````

## Required Attributes

**algorithm** (string): Name of the SLAM library/algorithm to be used. Current options are cartographer or orbslamv3.

**data_dir** (string): This is the data directory used for saving input sensor/map data and output maps/visualizations. It has an architecture consisting of three internal folders, config, data and map. If these have not been provided, they will be created by the SLAM service. The data in the data directory also dictate what type of SLAM will be run:

-   If no map is provided in the data folder, the SLAM algorithm will generate a new map using all the provided data (PURE MAPPING MODE)

-   If a map is found in the data folder, it will be used as a priori information for the SLAM run and only data generated after the map will be used. (PURE LOCALIZATION MODE/UPDATING MODE)

-   If a map_rate_sec is provided, then the system will overlay new data on any given map (PURE MAPPING MODE/UPDATING MODE)

**Sensors** (string[]): Names of sensors which are input to SLAM

## Optional Attributes

**map_rate_sec** (int): Map generation rate for saving current state (in seconds). The default value is 60. If an integer is less or equal to 0 then SLAM is run in localization mode.

**data_rate_ms** (int): Data generation rate for collecting sensor data to be fed into SLAM (in milliseconds). The default value is 200. If 0, no new data is sent to the SLAM algorithm.

**input_file_pattern** (string): File glob describing how to ingest previously saved sensor data. Must be in the form X:Y:Z where Z is how many files to skip while iterating between the start index, X and the end index Y. Note: X and Y are the file numbers since the most recent map data package in the data folder. If nil, includes all previously saved data.

**port** (string): Port for SLAM gRPC server. If running locally, this should be in the form "localhost:<PORT>". If no value is given a random available port will be assigned.

**config_params** (map[string] string): Parameters specific to the
inputted SLAM library.

## SLAM Library Attributes

The config_params is a catch-all attribute for parameters that are unique to the slam library being used. These often deal with the internal algorithms being run and will affect such aspects as submap size, update rate, and details on how to perform feature matching to name a few.

Details on what inputs can be included for the available libraries can be found below:

### OrbSLAM

OrbSLAM can perform sparse SLAM using monocular or RGB-D images (not stereo); this must be specified in the config_params (i.e., "mono" or "rgbd"). In addition the follow variables can be added to fine-tune cartographer's algorithm, all of which are optional:

<style>
table.here
{
table-layout:auto;
width=80%;
white-space:pre-wrap;
}

  </style>

<table class="here">
    <tr>
        <th>Parameter Mode</th>
        <th style="width:40%">Description - The Type of Slam to Use</th>
        <th>Default:<br>
        RGBD, Mono</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>orb_n\_features</td>
        <td>ORB parameter. Number of features per image</td>
        <td>1200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>orb_scale_factor</td>
        <td>ORB parameter. Scale factor between levels in the scale
         pyramid</td>
        <td>1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>orb_n\_levels</td>
        <td>ORB parameter. Number of levels in the scale pyramid</td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>orb_n\_ini_th_fast</td>
        <td>ORB parameter. Initial FAST threshold</td>
        <td>20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>orb_n\_min_th_fast</td>
        <td>ORB parameter. Lower threshold if no corners detected</td>
        <td>7</td>
</table>


If more mutable variables are desired for any supported SLAM library please submit a [git issue](https://github.com/viamrobotics/slam/issues) with the pertinent parameter.

# Hardware Requirements

*Forthcoming*

# Installation

## Via an App Image

Info on is available on JIRA Tickets, [DATA-123](https://viam.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DATA/boards/30?modal=detail&selectedIssue=DATA-123)
and
[DATA-133](https://viam.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DATA/boards/30?selectedIssue=DATA-133)

## Manual Installation

Perform a git clone on the slam repository using the recursive install flag to allow the sub packages to be downloaded as well.

````bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:viamrobotics/slam.git
````

### ORBSLAM3 Setup

This setup documents the current process for getting ORBSLAM3 working locally on a raspberry pi.

#### Dependencies

The following are the required dependencies for building and running ORBSLAM3. In addition you should ensure the most recent version of the orbslam submodule is located in your directory with

````bash
git submodule update \--init \--recursive
````

##### Pangolin - to setup run the following

````bash
git clone \--recursive
https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
cd Pangolin
./scripts/install_prerequisites.sh recommended
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install
````
##### OpenCV
````bash
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
````

##### Eigen
````bash
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
````
##### gRPC

To setup gRPC, use the following command:

````bash
cd \~/slam/slam-libraries
make pull-rdk
````

This command pulls a minimal copy of rdk and build c++ gRPC files off of our proto.

##### Other Dependencies
````bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
````

#### Building ORBSLAM3

To build ORBSLAM3 run
````bash
cd \~/slam/slam-libraries/viam-orb-slam
./build_orbslam.sh
````

Should the code fail the initial setup (your pi freezes and requires a restart), change the *make -j\`nproc\`* flags into *make -j2*

After building, use the following command to move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

````bash
sudo cp bin/orb_grpc_server /usr/local/bin
````
In addition, make sure the binary is added in SLAMlibraries.go for ORBSLAM3 in rdk.

Lastly, move the vocabulary file into your data directory. You must do this whenever a new data directory will be used.
````bash
cp ORB_SLAM3/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ~/YOUR_DATA_DIR/config
````
