_Changed in [RDK v0.2.36 and API v0.1.118](/appendix/release-notes/#25-april-2023)_

_3D Object Segmentation_ is the process of separating and returning a list of the identified "objects" from a 3D scene.
The "objects" are a list of point clouds with associated metadata, like the label, the 3D bounding box, and center coordinates of the object.

Any camera that can return 3D pointclouds can use 3D object segmentation.

The types of segmenters supported are:

- [**Obstacles point cloud (`obstacles_pointcloud`)**](#configure-an-obstacles_pointcloud-segmenter): A segmenter that identifies well-separated objects above a flat plane.
- [**Object detector (`detector_3d_segmenter`)**](#configure-a-detector_3d_segmenter): This model takes 2D bounding boxes from an object detector and projects the pixels in the bounding box to points in 3D space.
- [**Obstacles depth (`obstacles_depth`)**](#configure-an-obstacles_depth-segmenter): A segmenter for depth cameras that returns the perceived obstacles as a set of 3-dimensional bounding boxes, each with a Pose as a vector.

## Configure an `obstacles_pointcloud` segmenter

Radius clustering is a segmenter that identifies well separated objects above a flat plane.
It first identifies the biggest plane in the scene, eliminates all points below that plane, and begins clustering points above that plane based on how near they are to each other.
It is slower than other segmenters and can take up to 30 seconds to segment a scene.

The following parameters are available for a `"obstacles_pointcloud"`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Parameter | Inclusion | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `min_points_in_plane` | Optional | An integer that specifies how many points to put on the flat surface or ground plane when clustering. This is to distinguish between large planes, like the floors and walls, and small planes, like the tops of bottle caps. <br> Default: `500` </br> |
| `min_points_in_segment` | Optional | An integer that sets a minimum size to the returned objects, and filters out all other found objects below that size. |
| `clustering_radius` | Optional | An integer that specifies which neighboring points count as being "close enough" to be potentially put in the same cluster. This parameter determines how big the candidate clusters should be, or, how many points should be put on a flat surface. A small clustering radius is likely to split different parts of a large cluster into distinct objects. A large clustering radius is likely to aggregate closely spaced clusters into one object. <br> Default: `1` </br> |
| `clustering_strictness` | Optional | An integer that determines the probability threshold for sorting neighboring points into the same cluster, or how "easy" `viam-server` should determine it is to sort the points the robot's camera sees into this pointcloud. When the `clustering_radius` determines the size of the candidate clusters, then the clustering_strictness determines whether the candidates will count as a cluster. If `clustering_strictness` is set to a large value, many small clusters are likely to be made, rather than a few big clusters. The lower the number, the bigger your clusters will be. <br> Default: `5` </br> |
| `max_dist_from_plane_mm` | Optional | A float that determines how much area above and below an ideal ground plane should count as the plane for which points are removed. For fields with tall grass, this should be a high number. The default value is 100 mm. <br> Default: `100` </br> |
| `ground_plane_normal_vec` | Optional | A `(x,y,z)` vector that represents the normal vector of the ground plane. Different cameras have different coordinate systems. For example, a lidar's ground plane will point in the `+z` direction `(0, 0, 1)`. On the other hand, the intel realsense `+z` direction points out of the camera lens, and its ground plane is in the negative y direction `(0, -1, 0)`. <br> Default: `(0, 0, 1)` </br> |
| `ground_angle_tolerance_degs` | Optional | An integer that determines how strictly the found ground plane should match the `ground_plane_normal_vec`. For example, even if the ideal ground plane is purely flat, a rover may encounter slopes and hills. The algorithm should find a ground plane even if the found plane is at a slant, up to a certain point. <br> Default: `30` </br> |

Click **Save config** and proceed to [test your segmenter](#test-your-segmenter).

## Configure a `detector_3d_segmenter`

This model takes 2D bounding boxes from an [object detector](../detection/), and, using the intrinsic parameters of the chosen camera, projects the pixels in the bounding box to points in 3D space.
If the chosen camera is not equipped to do projections from 2D to 3D, then this vision model will fail.
The label and the pixels associated with the 2D detections become the label and point cloud associated with the 3D segmenter.

The following parameters are available for a `detector_3d_segmenter`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Parameter | Inclusion | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `detector_name`| **Required**  | The name of a registered detector vision service. The segmenter vision service uses the detections from `"detector_name"` to create the 3D segments. |
| `confidence_threshold_pct` | Optional | A number between 0 and 1 which represents a filter on object confidence scores. Detections that score below the threshold will be filtered out in the segmenter. The default is 0.5. |
| `mean_k` | **Required** | An integer parameter used in [a subroutine to eliminate the noise in the point clouds](https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/statistical_outlier.html). It should be set to be 5-10% of the minimum segment size. Start with 5% and go up if objects are still too noisy. If you donâ€™t want to use the filtering, set the number to 0 or less. |
| `sigma` | **Required** | A floating point parameter used in [a subroutine to eliminate the noise in the point clouds](https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/statistical_outlier.html). It should usually be set between 1.0 and 2.0. 1.25 is usually a good default. If you want the object result to be less noisy (at the risk of losing some data around its edges) set sigma to be lower. |

## Configure an `obstacles_depth` segmenter

This segmenter model is for depth cameras, and is best for motion planning with transient obstacles.
Use the segmenter to identify well separated objects above a flat plane.

    "attributes": {
        "h_min_m": 0.0,
        "h_max_m": 1.0,
        "theta_max_deg": 45,
        "return_pcds": "true",
        "with_geometries": "true"
    }
}
]
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

The following parameters are available for an `"obstacles_depth"` segmenter:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Parameter | Inclusion | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `with_geometries` | **Required** | Whether you would like multiple boxes, if `true`, or a single point, if `false`, returned within the `GeometryInFrame` object captured by this segmenter.  <br> Example: `"false"` </br> |
| `h_min_m` | Optional | The minimum vertical height in meters for an object to be considered an obstacle. <br> Default: `0.0` </br> |
| `h_max_m` | Optional | The maximum vertical height in meters at which an object is considered an obstacle. <br> Default: `1.0` </br> |
| `theta_max_deg` | Optional | The maximum slope at which an object is still not an obstacle. <br> Default: `45` </br> |
| `return_pcds` | Optional | Whether you would like pointclouds to be included within the GeometryInFrame object captured by this segmenter.  <br> Example: `"false"` </br> |

If you want to identify multiple boxes over the flat plane with your segmenter:

- First, [configure your frame system](/services/frame-system/#configuration) to configure the relative spatial orientation of the components of your robot, including your [camera](/components/camera/), within Viam's [frame system service](/services/frame-system/).
  - After configuring your frame system, your camera will populate its own `Properties` with these spatial intrinsic parameters from the frame system.
  - You can get those parameters from your camera through the [camera API](/components/camera/#getproperties).
- Next, set your segmenter's attribute `with_geometries: true`.
- The segmenter now returns multiple boxes within the `GeometryInFrame` object it captures.

If you choose not to configure the frame system, you can still identify single points over the flat plane with your segmenter:

- Set `with_geometries: false`.
- The segmenter now returns a single point within the `GeometryInFrame` object it captures.

Click **Save config** and proceed to [test your segmenter](#test-your-segmenter).

## Test your segmenter

The following code uses the [`GetObjectPointClouds`](/services/vision/#getobjectpointclouds) method to run a segmenter vision model on an image from the robot's camera `"cam1"`:

robot = await connect()

# Grab Viam's vision service for the segmenter
my_segmenter = VisionClient.from_robot(robot, "my_segmenter")

objects = await my_segmenter.get_object_point_clouds("cam1")

await robot.close()
```
