_Changed in [RDK v0.2.36 and API v0.1.118](/appendix/release-notes/#25-april-2023)_

_2D Object Detection_ is the process of taking a 2D image from a camera and identifying and drawing a box around the distinct "objects" of interest in the scene.
Any camera that can return 2D images can use 2D object detection.

The service provides different types of detectors, both based on heuristics and machine learning, so that you can create, register, and use detectors for any object you may need to identify.

The returned detections consist of the bounding box around the identified object, as well as its label and confidence score:

- `x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max` (int): specify the bounding box around the object.
- `class_name` (string): specifies the label of the found object.
- `confidence` (float): specifies the confidence of the assigned label.
  Between `0.0` and `1.0`, inclusive.

You can use the following types of detectors:

- [**color_detector**](#configure-a-color_detector): A heuristic detector that draws boxes around objects according to their hue (does not detect black, gray, and white).
- [**mlmodel**](#configure-a-mlmodel-detector): A machine learning detector that draws bounding boxes according to a ML model available on the robot’s hard drive.

## Configure a `color_detector`

A heuristic detector that draws boxes around objects according to their hue.
Color detectors do not detect black, perfect grays (grays where the red, green, and blue color component values are equal), or white.
It only detects hues found on the color wheel.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
Object colors can vary dramatically based on the light source.
We recommend you verify the desired color detection value under actual lighting conditions.
To determine the color value from the actual camera component image, you can use a pixel color tool, like [Color Picker for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-picker-for-chrome/clldacgmdnnanihiibdgemajcfkmfhia).

If the color is not reliably detected, increase the `hue_tolerance_pct`.

Add the Vision Service object to the services array in your raw JSON configuration:

``` json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
"services": [
  {
    "name": "<service_name>",
    "type": "vision",
    "model": "color_detector",
    "attributes": {
      "segment_size_px": <integer>,
      "detect_color": "#ABCDEF",
      "hue_tolerance_pct": <number>,
      "saturation_cutoff_pct": <number>,
      "value_cutoff_pct": <number>
    }
  },
  ... // Other services
]
```

      "hue_tolerance_pct": 0.07,

The following parameters are available for a `"color_detector"`.

| Parameter | Inclusion | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `segment_size_px` | _Required_ | An integer that sets a minimum size (in pixels) of a contiguous color region to be detected, and filters out all other found objects below that size. |
| `detect_color` | _Required_ | The color to detect in the image, as a string of the form `#RRGGBB`. The color is written as a hexadecimal string prefixed by ‘#’. |
| `hue_tolerance_pct` | _Required_ | A number bigger than 0.0 and smaller than or equal to 1.0 that defines how strictly the detector must match to the hue of the color requested. ~0.0 means the color must match exactly, while 1.0 matches to every color, regardless of the input color. 0.05 is a good starting value. |
| `saturation_cutoff_pct` | _Optional_ | A number > 0.0 and <= 1.0 which defines the minimum saturation before a color is ignored. Defaults to 0.2. |
| `value_cutoff_pct` | _Optional_ | A number > 0.0 and <= 1.0 which defines the minimum value before a color is ignored. Defaults to 0.3. |

{{% alert title="Info" color="info" %}}

**hue_tolerance_pct**, **saturation_cutoff_pct**, and **value_cutoff_pct** refer to hue, saturation, and value (brightness) in the HSV Color Model, but do not set color values in Viam.

**hue_tolerance_pct** specifies the exactness of the color match to **detect_color**.

The optional **saturation_cutoff_pct** and **value_cutoff_pct** attributes specify cutoff thresholds levels for saturation and brightness, rather than specifying color saturation and brightness as they do in the standard HSV Color Model.

Click **Save config** and head to the **Components** tab.
Proceed to [Add a camera component and a "transform" model](#add-a-camera-component-and-a-transform-model).

## Configure a `mlmodel` detector

A machine learning detector that draws bounding boxes according to the specified tensorflow-lite model file available on the robot’s hard drive.
To create a `mlmodel` classifier, you need an [ML Model Service with a suitable model](../../ml/).

Navigate to the [robot page on the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/robots).
Click on the robot you wish to add the Vision Service to.
Select the **Config** tab, and click on **Services**.

Scroll to the **Create Service** section.

2. Enter a name as the **Name**.
3. Select **ML Model** as the **Model**.
4. Click **Create Service**.

Click **Save config** and head to the **Components** tab.

## Add a camera component and a "transform" model

You cannot interact directly with the [Vision Service](/services/vision/).
To be able to interact with the Vision Service you must:

1. Configure a physical [camera component](../../../components/camera/).
2. Configure a [transform camera](../../../components/camera/transform/) to view output from the detector overlaid on images from the physical camera.

After adding the component and its attributes, click **Save config**.

Wait for the robot to reload, and then go to the **Control** tab to test the stream of detections.

## Code

The following code gets the robot’s vision service and then runs a color detector vision model on output from the robot's camera `"cam1"`:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
from viam.services.vision import VisionClient, VisModelConfig, VisModelType

robot = await connect()
# Grab camera from the robot
cam1 = Camera.from_robot(robot, "cam1")
# Grab Viam's vision service for the detector
my_detector = VisionClient.from_robot(robot, "my_detector")

detections = await my_detector.get_detections_from_camera(cam1)

# If you need to get an image first and then run detections on it,
# you can do it this way (generally slower but useful if you need to
# use the image afterwards):
img = await cam1.get_image()
detections_from_image = await my_detector.get_detections(img)

await robot.close()
```
