_2D Object Detection_ is the process of taking a 2D image from a camera and identifying and drawing a box around the distinct "objects" of interest in the scene.
Any camera that can return 2D images can use 2D object detection.

The service provides different types of detectors, both based on heuristics and machine learning, so that you can create, register, and use detectors for any object you may need to identify.

The returned detections consist of the bounding box around the identified object, as well as its label and confidence score:

- `x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max` (int): specify the bounding box around the object.
- `class_name` (string): specifies the label of the found object.
- `confidence` (float): specifies the confidence of the assigned label.
  Between `0.0` and `1.0`, inclusive.

## Detector Types

You can use the following types of detectors:

- [**color_detector**](#color_detector): A heuristic detector that draws boxes around objects according to their hue (does not detect black, gray, and white).
- [**tflite_detector**](#tflite_detector): A machine learning detector that draws bounding boxes according to the specified .tflite model file available on the robot’s hard drive.

### `color_detector`

A heuristic detector that draws boxes around objects according to their hue.
Color detectors do not detect black, perfect grays (grays where the red, green, and blue color component values are equal), or white.
It only detects hues found on the color wheel.

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
Object colors can vary dramatically based on the light source.
We recommend you verify the desired color detection value under actual lighting conditions.
To determine the color value from the actual camera component image, you can use a pixel color tool, like [Color Picker for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-picker-for-chrome/clldacgmdnnanihiibdgemajcfkmfhia).

If the color is not reliably detected, increase the `hue_tolerance_pct`.

``` json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "register_models": [
        {
            "name": "<detector_name>",
            "type": "color_detector",
            "parameters": {
              "detect_color" : "#ABCDEF",
              "hue_tolerance_pct": <number>,
              "segment_size_px": <integer>,
              "saturation_cutoff_pct": <number>,
              "value_cutoff_pct" <number>
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The following parameters are available for a `"color_detector"`.
For an example see [Configuration](#configuration).

| Parameter | Inclusion | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `detect_color` | _Required_ | The color to detect in the image, as a string of the form `#RRGGBB`. The color is written as a hexadecimal string prefixed by ‘#’. |
| `hue_tolerance_pct` | _Required_ | A number bigger than 0.0 and smaller than or equal to 1.0 that defines how strictly the detector must match to the hue of the color requested. ~0.0 means the color must match exactly, while 1.0 matches to every color, regardless of the input color. 0.05 is a good starting value. |
| `segment_size_px` | _Required_ | An integer that sets a minimum size (in pixels) of a contiguous color region to be detected, and filters out all other found objects below that size. |
| `saturation_cutoff_pct` | _Optional_ | A number > 0.0 and <= 1.0 which defines the minimum saturation before a color is ignored. Defaults to 0.2. |
| `value_cutoff_pct` | _Optional_ | A number > 0.0 and <= 1.0 which defines the minimum value before a color is ignored. Defaults to 0.3. |

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}

**hue_tolerance_pct**, **saturation_cutoff_pct**, and **value_cutoff_pct** refer to hue, saturation, and value (brightness) in the HSV Color Model, but do not set color values in Viam.

**hue_tolerance_pct** specifies the exactness of the color match to **detect_color**.

The optional **saturation_cutoff_pct** and **value_cutoff_pct** attributes specify cutoff thresholds levels for saturation and brightness, rather than specifying color saturation and brightness as they do in the standard HSV Color Model.

### `tflite_detector`

A machine learning detector that draws bounding boxes according to the specified tensorflow-lite model file available on the robot’s hard drive.

``` json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
    "register_models": [
        {
            "name": "<detector_name>",
            "type": "tflite_classifier",
            "parameters": {
              "model_path" : "/path/to/model.tflite",
              "label_path": "/path/to/labels.txt",
              "num_threads": <number>
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The following parameters are available for a `"tflite_classifier"`.
For an example see [Configuration](#configuration).

| Parameter | Inclusion | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `model_path`| _Required_ | The path to the `.tflite model` file, as a `string`. |
| `num_threads`| _Optional_ | An integer that defines how many CPU threads to use to run inference. The default value is 1. |
| `label_path`| _Optional_ | The path to a `.txt` file that holds class labels for your TFLite model, as a `string`. The SDK expects this text file to contain an ordered listing of the class labels. Without this file, classes will read as "1", "2", and so on. |

#### `tflite_model` Limitations

We strongly recommend that you package your `.tflite` model with metadata in [the standard form](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-support/blob/560bc055c2f11772f803916cb9ca23236a80bf9d/tensorflow_lite_support/metadata/metadata_schema.fbs).

In the absence of metadata, your `.tflite` model must satisfy the following requirements:

- A single input tensor representing the image of type UInt8 (expecting values from 0 to 255) or Float 32 (values from -1 to 1).
- At least 3 output tensors (the rest won’t be read) containing the bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores (in that order).
- Bounding box output tensor must be ordered [x x y y], where x is an x-boundary (xmin or xmax) of the bounding box and the same is true for y.
  Each value should be between 0 and 1, designating the percentage of the image at which the boundary can be found.

These requirements are satisfied by a few publicly available model architectures including EfficientDet, MobileNet, and SSD MobileNet V1.
You can use one of these architectures or build your own.

## Configuration

### Add the service and detector

Navigate to the [robot page on the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/robots).
Click on the robot you wish to add the Vision Service to.
Select the **CONFIG** tab, and click on **SERVICES**.

Scroll to the **Create Service** section.
To create a [Vision Service](/services/vision/):

1. Select `Vision` as the **Type**.
2. Enter a name as the **Name**.
3. Click **Create Service**.

<img src="../../../tutorials/img/try-viam-color-detection/create-service.png" alt="The Create Service panel lists the type as vision and name as vision, with a Create Service button.">

In your Vision Service's panel, add a detector into the **Attributes** field.
For example:

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
 "register_models": [
   {
     "name": "my_color_detector",
     "type": "color_detector",
     "parameters": {
       "detect_color": "#7a4f5c",
       "hue_tolerance_pct": 0.06,
       "segment_size_px": 100
     }
   }
 ]
}
```

Click **SAVE CONFIG** and head to the **COMPONENTS** tab.

{{%expand "You can also configure the entire Vision Service and detector in raw JSON" %}}

To add a vision model to your robot, add the `name`, `type`, and `parameters` of the desired detector to the `register_models` in the attributes field of the Vision Service config.
For example:

``` json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
"services": [
    {
        "name": "vision1",
        "type": "vision",
        "attributes": {
          "register_models": [
            {
              "name": "my_color_detector",
              "type": "color_detector",
              "parameters": {
                "detect_color" : "#A3E2FF",
                "hue_tolerance_pct": 0.06,
                "segment_size_px": 100
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "my_classifier",
              "type": "tflite_classifier",
              "parameters": {
                "model_path" : "/path/to/model.tflite",
                "label_path": "/path/to/labels.txt",
                "num_threads": 1
              }
            },
            {
                "name": "my_segmenter",
                "type": "radius_clustering_segmenter",
                "parameters": {
                    "min_points_in_plane": 2,
                    "min_points_in_segment": 2,
                    "clustering_radius_mm": 3.0,
                    "mean_k_filtering": 0
                }
            }
          ]
        }
    }
]
```

### Add a camera component and a "transform" model

You cannot interact directly with the [Vision Service](/services/vision/).
To be able to interact with the Vision Service you must:

1. Configure a physical [camera component](../../../components/camera).
2. Configure a [transform camera](../../../components/camera/transform) to view output from the detector overlaid on images from the physical camera.

After adding the component and its attributes, click **SAVE CONFIG**.

Wait for the robot to reload, and then go to the **CONTROL** tab to test the stream of detections.

## Code

The following code gets the robot’s vision service and then runs a color detector vision model on an image from the robot's camera `"camera_1"`:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
from viam.services.vision import VisionServiceClient, VisModelConfig, VisModelType

robot = await connect()
# grab camera from the robot
cam1 = Camera.from_robot(robot, "cam1")
# grab Viam's vision service which has the TFLite detector already registered
vision = VisionServiceClient.from_robot(robot)

print("Vision Resources:")
print(await vision.get_detector_names())

# Apply the color detector configured as detector_1 to the image from your camera configured as "camera_1"
detections = await vision.get_detections_from_camera("camera_1", "my_color_detector")

await robot.close()
```

}
```
