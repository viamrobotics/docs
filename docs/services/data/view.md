After the data management service synchronizes the uploaded data in Viam, you can view it on the [**DATA** page in the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/data/view).

![Images, files, and sensors tabs](/services/data/tabs.png)

The **DATA** page displays data from all resources you are an owner of within the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organization" >}} you are currently authenticated to.
This includes data from any locations shared with your organizations.
For more information on who can do what with data, see [Permissions](/cloud/rbac/#permissions).

The **DATA** page shows data about:

- **Images**: PNG or JPEG files
- **Point clouds**: collections of points in 3D space
- **Files**: binary data like .mov files
- **Sensors**: tabular sensor counts (like gantry position)

If you click on an image or a file, a **Details** panel appears on the right with capture metadata.

## Filter data

On the [**DATA** page in the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/data/view), you can filter data in the left **Filters** panel.
You can filter by several categories including machine name, location, or timestamp range.

For example, if you specify `Rover Rental` for location and click **Apply**, you can see all data captured on machines that belong to your `Rover Rental` location.

To [view only data captured from one machine part or from one component or service](/services/data/capture/#view-captured-data), click on the menu on the respective resource on the configuration page and select **View captured data**.

{{< /alert >}}

You can also filter data using the [Viam Python SDK](https://python.viam.dev/).
For example, you could use the [`BinaryDataByFilter`](/appendix/apis/data-client/#binarydatabyfilter) or [`TabularDataByFilter`](/appendix/apis/data-client/#tabulardatabyfilter) methods to filter binary data or sensor data respectively.

To query your data using {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="sql" text="SQL" >}} or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="mql" text="MQL" >}} instead, see [Query Data using SQL / MQL](/use-cases/sensor-data-query/).

## Delete data

You can delete image or file data from the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
To delete image data, hover over an image and click on the checkbox on the image.
Then click on **Delete selected**.
You can delete multiple images at once by selecting them individually or by holding the **SHIFT** key to select a range of images.
To delete a file, click on the file in the **Files** subtab and click the **Delete** icon.

To delete all image, file, or sensor data respectively, click on **DELETE ALL** in the top right corner.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
If you need to delete many images that are from a specific time frame or machine, you can apply a [filter](#filter-data) and then click **DELETE ALL**.
{{< /alert >}}

You can also delete data using the [Viam CLI](/cli/).

## Next steps

To export your captured data from the cloud, see [Export Data](../export/).

If you have synced data, such as [sensor](/components/sensor/) readings, you can [query that data with SQL or MQL](/use-cases/sensor-data-query/) from the Viam app or a MQL-compatible client.
If you have synced images, you can use those images to [train machine learning models](/services/ml/train-model/) within the Viam app.

For a comprehensive tutorial on using data capture and synchronization together with the ML model service, see [Capture Data and Train a Model](/tutorials/services/data-mlmodel-tutorial/).
