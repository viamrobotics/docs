[The Cartographer Project](https://github.com/cartographer-project) contains a C++ library that performs dense SLAM.

To use Cartographer with the Viam [SLAM service](/services/slam/), you can use the [`cartographer`](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/cartographer) [modular resource](/modular-resources/).
See [Modular resources](/modular-resources/#the-viam-registry) for instructions on using a module from the Viam registry on your robot.

The source code for this module is available on the [`viam-cartographer` GitHub repository](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-cartographer).

{{% alert title="Info" color="info" %}}

Cartographer supports taking **2D LiDAR** or **3D LiDAR** data and optionally **inertial measurement unit (IMU)** and/or **odometry** data as input.

However, currently, the `cartographer` modular resource only supports taking **2D LiDAR** and optionally **IMU** data as input.
Support for taking **3D LiDAR** and **odometry** data as input may be added in the future.

{{% /alert %}}

Cartographer can operate:

- _online_ [using a live robot](#use-a-live-robot) for creating and updating maps or for localization
- _offline_ [using previously captured data](#use-previously-captured-data) for creating and updating maps

## Use a live robot

The `cartographer` module supports three modes of operation:

- [Create a new map](#create-a-new-map)
- [Update an existing map](#update-an-existing-map)
- [Pure localization](#localize-only)

Creating and updating SLAM maps with Cartographer is especially CPU-intensive, so the `cartographer` modular resource runs in the cloud for these two tasks.
For doing pure localization on an existing map, the `cartographer` modular resource runs locally on your robot.

See Viam's [Pricing](https://www.viam.com/product/pricing) page to understand the costs associated with running Cartographer in the cloud.

### Requirements

- You must have an RPlidar, such as the [RPlidar A1](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1) or [RPlidar A3](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A3), physically connected to your robot.

  Be sure to position the RPlidar so that it **faces forward in the direction of travel**. For example, if you are using a Viam Rover and the [RPlidar A1](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1) model, mount it to the Rover so that the **pointed** end of the RPlidar mount housing is facing in the same direction as the webcam.

  If you need a **mount plate** for your RPlidar A1 or A3 model, you can 3D print an adapter plate using the following:

  - [RPlidar A1 adapter STL](https://github.com/viamrobotics/Rover-VR1/blob/master/CAD/RPIidarA1_adapter.STL)
  - [RPlidar A3 adapter STL](https://github.com/viamrobotics/Rover-VR1/blob/master/CAD/RPIidarA3_adapter.STL)

- In addition, you must [add the `rplidar` module to your robot](/modular-resources/examples/rplidar/) to support the RPlidar hardware, if you have not done so already.

  {{< alert title="SUPPORT" color="note" >}}

  Currently, the `rplidar` and `cartographer` modules support the Linux platform only.

  {{< /alert >}}

### Create a new map

To create a new map, follow the instructions below.
Creating a new map uses an instance of the cartographer module running in the cloud.

1. Configure your `cartographer` SLAM service

   After installing your physical RPlidar and adding the `rplidar` module as outlined in the [requirements](#requirements) section, follow the steps below to add the `cartographer` module to your robot:

   {{< tabs name="Create new map">}}
   {{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}
   Follow the instructions below to set up the `cartographer` module on your robot:

   1. Navigate to the **Config** tab of your robot's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
   1. Click on the **Services** subtab and click **Create service** in the lower-left corner.
   1. Select **SLAM**, then select `cartographer`.
      You can also search for "cartographer".
   1. Click **Add module**, give your service a name of your choice, then click **Create**.
   1. In the resulting `SLAM` service configuration pane, first choose `Create new map` as the **Mapping mode**, then configure the rest of the **Attributes** for that mapping mode:

      - **Camera**: Select the `name` of the camera component that you created when you [added the `rplidar` module to your robot](/modular-resources/examples/rplidar/).
        Example: "my-rplidar"
        - Then set a **Data capture rate (Hz)** for it.
          Example: "5"
      - **Movement Sensor (Optional)**: Select the `name` of a movement sensor component that implements the `GetAngularVelocity` and `GetLinearAcceleration` methods of the movement sensor API.
        Example: "my-imu"
        - Then set a **Data capture rate (Hz)** for it.
          Example: "20"
      - **Minimum range (meters)**: Set the minimum range of your `rplidar`.
        See [config params](#config_params) for suggested values for RPLidar A1 and A3.
      - **Maximum range (meters)**: Set the maximum range of your `rplidar`.
        See [config params](#config_params) for suggested values for RPLidar A1 and A3.

      If you would like to tune additional Cartographer parameters, you can expand **Show additional parameters**.
      See the [`config_params`](#config_params) section for more information on the other parameters.

   To save your changes, click **Save config** at the bottom of the page.

   Check the **Logs** tab of your robot in the Viam app to make sure your RPlidar has connected and no errors are being raised.

   {{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
   Be aware that data is not only captured when a slam session is running.
   [Data Capture](/services/data/configure-data-capture/) continuously monitors and captures your robot's sensor data while the robot is running.
   To avoid incurring charges while not in use, [turn off data capture for your sensors](/services/data/configure-data-capture/).
   {{< /alert >}}

   For more information about the configuration attributes, see [Attributes](#attributes).

1. Start a mapping session

   Navigate to the **Control** tab on your robot's page and click on the drop-down menu matching the `name` of the service you created.
   On the cartographer panel, you can start a mapping session.

   When you start a mapping session, Cartographer uses the data captured from when you click **Start session** until you click **End session** to create the map.

   Enter a name for your new map and click **Start session**.
   Wait for the slam session to finish starting up in the cloud, which **takes about 2 minutes**.

   Make sure to either **manually refresh**, or **change the refresh frequency** to something other than `Manual`.

   ![slam RC card start session](/services/slam/slam-RC-card-start-session.png)

   While the slam session is starting, you will see a loading screen.

   ![slam RC card wait for session to finish starting](/services/slam/slam-RC-card-wait-for-session-to-finish-starting.png)

   Once the slam session has finished starting, your first pointcloud will appear.

   ![slam RC card first pointcloud](/services/slam/slam-RC-card-first-pointcloud.png)

   You can see that your cloud slam session is in progress from your **Location** page's **SLAM library** tab.

   ![offline mapping maps computing table](/services/slam/offline-mapping-maps-computing-table.png)

   When you are ready to end the slam session, return to your robot's **Control** tab and click **End session**.
   If you do not click **End session**, the slam session will automatically end after 45 minutes.

   Once the session has ended, the map is saved to your **Location** page's **SLAM library** tab.

   ![offline mapping available maps](/services/slam/offline-mapping-available-maps.png)

   You can click `View map` to view the map in a dynamic pointcloud viewer.

   ![slam library view map](/services/slam/slam-library-view-map.png)

### Update an existing map

To update an existing map with new pointcloud data from a new SLAM session, follow the instructions below.
Updating an existing map uses an instance of the `cartographer` module running in the cloud, and _does not_ overwrite the existing map.

1. Configure your `cartographer` SLAM service

   {{< tabs name="Update existing map">}}
   {{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

   Configure **Select map** and **Map version** with the name and version of the map you would like to update.
   For the other attributes, review the information in [Create a new map](#create-a-new-map).
   You can see more details about the available maps from your robot's **Location** page under the **SLAM library** tab.

   Navigate to the **Control** tab on your robot's page and click on the drop-down menu matching the `name` of the service you created.
   On the cartographer panel, you can start a mapping session.

   When you start a mapping session, Cartographer uses the data captured from when you click **Start session** until you click **End session** to create the map.

   Once you click **End session**, the map is uploaded to the cloud and visible on your **Location** page under **SLAM library**.

   Click **Start session**.
   Wait for the slam session to finish starting up in the cloud, which **takes about 2 minutes**.

   Once the slam session has started, you can follow the same steps as in [Create a new map](#create-a-new-map) to view your map.

{{% alert title="Info" color="info" %}}

Cartographer may take several minutes to find your robot's position on the existing map.
In the meantime, your robot will show up at the map's origin (with the `(x,y)` coordinates `(0,0)`).

{{% /alert %}}

### Localize only

In this mode, the `cartographer` module on your robot executes the Cartographer algorithm itself locally to find its position on a map.

1.  Configure your `cartographer` SLAM service

    {{< tabs name="Localize only">}}
    {{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

The configuration is similar to the configuration for [updating an existing map](#update-an-existing-map), except instead of configuring a `Data capture rate (Hz)` on the camera and movement sensor, set a `Data polling rate (Hz)` on both.
The `cartographer` module on your robot polls the live LiDAR and IMU directly at these rates, whereas the capture rate is only used when data is being sent to the cloud.

#### `config_params`

{{< readfile "/static/include/services/cartographer/configparams.md" >}}

## Use previously captured data

You can specify a range of **previously captured** LiDAR and optional IMU data to create a map or update an existing map in the cloud.
You can browse your previously captured data from the **Data** page under the **Point clouds** tab (for LiDAR data) and **Sensors** tab (for IMU data).

### Requirements

To create a map, you must have already captured LiDAR data in the location in which you would like to create the map.

The following example shows the previously-captured LiDAR data under the **Point clouds** tab for a robot named `test`.
Selecting a row opens a pane to the right that contains more information, such as the `Robot ID` of the robot the component belongs to:

{{<imgproc src="/services/slam/offline-mapping-pointcloud-data.png" resize="1200x" declaredimensions=true alt="UI showing captured point clouds">}}

Example of previously captured IMU data:

{{<imgproc src="/services/slam/offline-mapping-imu-data.png" resize="1200x" declaredimensions=true alt="UI showing captured sensor data">}}

### Create or update a map

Navigate to the **SLAM library** tab on your location page, and click **Make new map** on the top right and specify a map name or click **Update map** next to an existing map.

1. Enter the **Robot name**, **Camera name**, and optionally the **Movement Sensor name** of the components whose previously captured data you want to use to create or update a map.
   If your robot has been deleted, you can alternatively specify the **robot ID**.
1. Adjust the configuration parameters as needed.

### View the Map

Unlike in `Online` mode, you cannot see the map being created while the slam session is in progress, but similar to when creating or updating a map in `Online` mode, you can see that your cloud slam session is in progress from your **Location** page's **SLAM library** tab.
When all the data has been processed (or 45 minutes have passed, whichever occurs first), the map will be saved to your **Location** page's **SLAM library** tab.

## SLAM Mapping Best Practices

The best way to improve map quality is by taking extra care when creating the initial map.
While in a slam session, you should:

- turn gently and gradually, completely avoiding sudden quick turns
- make frequent loop closures, arriving back at a previously mapped area so the robot can correct for errors in the map layout
- stay relatively (but not extremely) close to walls
- use a robot that can go smoothly over bumps and transitions between flooring areas
- drive at a moderate speed

You can find additional assistance in the [Troubleshooting section](/appendix/troubleshooting/).
