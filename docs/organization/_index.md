The [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/) allows you to organize your fleet and access to it with:

{{< cards >}}
  {{% card link="/organization/organizations" size="small" %}}
  {{% card link="/organization/locations" size="small" %}}
  {{% card link="/organization/robots" size="small" %}}
  {{% card link="/organization/permissions" size="small" %}}
{{< /cards >}}

<br>

You can also manage and control your robots from the command line with our [CLI](cli).
