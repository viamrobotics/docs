_Coming soon._

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) ia a way to enforce security in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) by assigning users roles that confer permissions:

- **Owner**: Can see and edit [every tab on the robot page](../../fleet).
- **Operator**: Can see and use only the [remote control tab](../../fleet#control).
  Cannot see or edit the [**SETUP**](../../fleet#setup), [**CONFIG**](../../fleet#configuration), [**HISTORY**](../../fleet#history), [**LOGS**](../../fleet#logs), [**CODE SAMPLE**](../../fleet#code-sample), or [**SECURITY**](../../fleet#security) tabs.

A user can have one or more roles, granting the user the respective permissions of each role.
