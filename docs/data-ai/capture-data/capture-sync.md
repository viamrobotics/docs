You can use data management service to capture and sync data from your machine to the cloud.
You can capture data from [supported components and services](#supported-resources) or from arbitrary folders on your machines.

## Configure the data management service

To start, configure the data management service to capture and sync data.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

From your machine's **CONFIGURE** tab in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com), add the `data management` service.
On the panel that appears, configure data capture and sync attributes as applicable.
To both capture data and sync it to the cloud, keep both **Capturing** and **Syncing** switched on.

Click the **Save** button in the top right corner of the page to save your config.

### Capture directly to MongoDB

Data capture supports capturing tabular data directly to MongoDB in addition to capturing to disk.

This feature is intended to support use cases like offline dashboards which don't require strong data delivery or consistency guarantees.

Here is a sample configuration that will capture fake sensor readings both to the configured MongoDB URI as well as to the `~/.viam/capture` directory on disk:

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "sensor-1",
      "namespace": "rdk",
      "type": "sensor",
      "model": "fake",
      "attributes": {},
      "service_configs": [
        {
          "type": "data_manager",
          "attributes": {
            "capture_methods": [
              {
                "method": "Readings",
                "capture_frequency_hz": 0.5,
                "additional_params": {}
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "data_manager-1",
      "namespace": "rdk",
      "type": "data_manager",
      "attributes": {
        "mongo_capture_config": {
          "uri": "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When `mongo_capture_config.uri` is configured, data capture will attempt to connect to the configured MongoDB server and write captured tabular data to the configured `mongo_capture_config.database` and `mongo_capture_config.collection` (or their defaults if unconfigured) after enqueuing that data to be written to disk.

If writes to MongoDB fail for any reason, data capture will log an error for each failed write and continue capturing.

Failing to write to MongoDB doesn't affect capturing and syncing data to cloud storage other than adding capture latency.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="caution" >}}

- Capturing directly to MongoDB may write data to MongoDB that later fails to be written to disk (and therefore never gets synced to cloud storage).
- Capturing directly to MongoDB does not retry failed writes to MongoDB. As a consequence, it is NOT guaranteed all data captured will be written to MongoDB.
  This can happen in cases such as MongoDB being inaccessible to `viam-server` or writes timing out.
- Capturing directly to MongoDB may reduce the maximum frequency that data capture can capture data due to the added latency of writing to MongoDB.
  If your use case needs to support very high capture rates, this feature may not be appropriate.

{{< /alert >}}

## Configure data capture

You can capture data for any {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resource" >}} that supports it, including resources on {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="remote-part" text="remote parts" >}}.
Scroll to the resource card you wish to configure data capture and sync on.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Regular" %}}

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Config builder" %}}

For each resource you can capture data for, there is a **Data capture** section in its panel.
Select a **Method** and specify a capture **Frequency** in hertz, for example to `0.1` to capture an image every 10 seconds.
You can add multiple methods with different capture frequencies.
Some methods will prompt you to add additional parameters.

The available methods, and corresponding additional parameters, will depend on the component or service type.
For example, a camera has the options `ReadImage` and `NextPointCloud`.
Keep in mind that some models do not support all options, for example webcams do not capture point clouds, and choose the method accordingly.

![component config example](/services/data/data-service-component-config.png)

{{< alert title="Caution" color="caution" >}}

Avoid configuring data capture to higher rates than your hardware can handle, as this leads to performance degradation.

{{% tab name="Remote parts" %}}

Viam supports data capture from {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}} on {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="remote-part" text="remote parts" >}}.
For example, if you use a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}} that does not have a Linux operating system or that does not have enough storage or processing power, you can still process and capture the data from that part's resources by adding it as a remote part.

Currently, you can only configure data capture from remote resources in your JSON configuration.
To add them to your JSON configuration you must explicitly add the remote resource's `type`, `model`, `name`, and `additional_params` to the `data_manager` service configuration in the `remotes` configuration:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `type` | The type tells your machine what the resource is. For example, a board. |
| `model` | The model is a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model-namespace-triplet" text="colon-delimited-triplet" >}} that specifies the namespace, the type of the part, and the part itself. |
| `name` | The name specifies the fully qualified name of the part. |
| `additional_params` | The additional parameters specify the data sources when you are using a board. |

{{< expand "Click to view example JSON configuration for an ESP32 board" >}}

The following example shows the configuration of the remote part, in this case an [ESP32 board](/operate/reference/components/board/esp32/).
This config is just like that of a non-remote part; the remote connection is established by the main part (in the next expandable example).

The following attributes are available for data capture configuration:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Name               | Type   | Required? | Description |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| `capture_frequency_hz` | float   | **Required** | Frequency in hertz at which to capture data. For example, to capture a reading every 2 seconds, enter `0.5`. |
| `method` | string | **Required** | Depends on the type of component or service. See [Supported components and services](/data-ai/capture-data/capture-sync/#supported-resources). |
| `retention_policy` | object | Optional | Option to configure how long data collected by this component or service should remain stored in the Viam Cloud. You must set this in JSON mode. See the JSON example for a camera component. <br> **Options:** `"days": <int>`, `"binary_limit_gb": <int>`, `"tabular_limit_gb": <int>`. <br> Days are in UTC time. Setting a retention policy of 1 day means that data stored now will be deleted the following day **in UTC time**. You can set either or both of the size limit options and size is in gigabytes. |
| `additional_params` | depends | depends | Varies based on the method. For example, `ReadImage` requires a MIME type. |

If cloud sync is enabled, the data management service deletes captured data once it has successfully synced to the cloud.

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}

If your robot is offline and can't sync and your machine's disk fills up beyond a certain threshold, the data management service will delete captured data to free up additional space and maintain a working machine.

{{< /alert >}}

{{< expand "Click for more automatic data deletion details" >}}

With `viam-server`, the data management service will also automatically delete local data in the event your machine's local storage fills up.
Local data is automatically deleted when _all_ of the following conditions are met:

- Data capture is enabled on the data management service
- Local disk usage percentage is greater than or equal to 90%
- The Viam capture directory is at least 50% of the current local disk usage

If local disk usage is greater than or equal to 90%, but the Viam capture directory is not at least 50% of that usage, a warning log message will be emitted instead and no action will be taken.

Automatic file deletion only applies to files in the specified Viam capture directory, which is set to `~/.viam/capture` by default.
Data outside of this directory is not touched by automatic data deletion.

If your machine captures a large amount of data, or frequently goes offline for long periods of time while capturing data, consider moving the Viam capture directory to a larger, dedicated storage device on your machine if available.
You can change the capture directory using the `capture_dir` attribute.

You can also control how local data is deleted if your machine's local storage becomes full, using the `delete_every_nth_when_disk_full` attribute.

## Stop data capture

If this is a test project, make sure you stop data capture to avoid charges for a large amount of unwanted data.

In the **Data capture** section of your resource's configuration card, toggle the switch to **Off**.

Click the **Save** button in the top right corner of the page to save your config.

## View captured data

To view all the captured data you have access to, go to the [**DATA** tab](https://app.viam.com/data/view) where you can filter by location, type of data, and more.

You can also access data from a resource or machine part menu.

## Supported resources

The following components and services support data capture and cloud sync:

{{< readfile "/static/include/data/capture-supported.md" >}}

## Considerations

- **Capturing too much data**: You can [use filtering to collect and sync only certain images](/data-ai/capture-data/filter-before-sync/) to capture data selectively.
- **Rentention policy**: Set a `retention_policy` attribute in your [data capture configuration](#configure-data-capture) to avoid keeping data stored in the Viam Cloud longer than a specified number of days.
- **Pausing sync**: You can pause cloud sync at any time by navigating to your machine's **CONFIGURE** tab and disabling **Syncing** for your data management service.

  If you have captured data that you do not want to sync, delete the data on the machine before resuming cloud sync.
  To delete the data locally, `ssh` into your machine and delete the data in the directory where you capture data.

- **Sync data conditionally**: You can use a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="module" >}} to sync data only when a certain logic condition is met, instead of at a regular time interval.
  For example, if you rely on mobile data but have intermittent WiFi connection in certain locations or at certain times of the day, you may want to trigger sync to only occur when these conditions are met.
  To set up triggers for syncing see [Conditional cloud sync](/data-ai/capture-data/conditional-sync/).

## Next steps

Now that you have captured data, you could [create a dataset](/data-ai/ai/create-dataset/) and use this data to [train your own Machine Learning model](/data-ai/ai/train-tflite/) with the Viam platform.
