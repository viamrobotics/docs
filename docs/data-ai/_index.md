Machine learning (ML) provides your machines with the ability to adjust their behavior based on models that recognize patterns or make predictions.

Common use cases include:

- Object detection, which enables machines to detect people, animals, plants, or other objects with bounding boxes, and to perform actions when they are detected.
- Object classification, which enables machines to separate people, animals, plants, or other objects into predefined categories based on their characteristics, and to perform different actions based on the classes of objects.
- Speech recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis, which enable machines to verbally communicate with us.
