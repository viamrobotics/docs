After training or uploading a machine learning model, use a machine learning (ML) model service to deploy the ML model to your machine.

## Deploy your ML model on an ML model service

1. Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of one of your machine in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
2. Add an ML model service that supports the ML model you want to use.
   - For example, use the `ML model / TFLite CPU` service for TFlite ML models that you trained with Viam's built-in training.

Viam currently supports the following frameworks:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Model Framework | ML Model Service | Hardware Support | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) | [`tflite_cpu`](https://github.com/viam-modules/mlmodel-tflite) | linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64 | Quantized version of TensorFlow that has reduced compatibility for models but supports more hardware. Uploaded models must adhere to the [model requirements.](https://github.com/viam-modules/mlmodel-tflite) |
| [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) | [`onnx-cpu`](https://github.com/viam-labs/onnx-cpu), [`triton`](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-mlmodelservice-triton) |  Nvidia GPU, linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64 | Universal format that is not optimized for hardware inference but runs on a wide variety of machines. |
| [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) | [`tensorflow-cpu`](https://github.com/viam-modules/tensorflow-cpu), [`triton`](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-mlmodelservice-triton) | Nvidia GPU, linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64 | A full framework that is made for more production-ready systems. |
| [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) | [`torch-cpu`](https://github.com/viam-modules/torch), [`triton`](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-mlmodelservice-triton) | Nvidia GPU, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64 | A full framework that was built primarily for research. Because of this, it is much faster to do iterative development with (model doesn’t have to be predefined) but it is not as “production ready” as TensorFlow. It is the most common framework for OSS models because it is the go-to framework for ML researchers. |

{{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
For some models of the ML model service, like the [Triton ML model service](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-mlmodelservice-triton/) for Jetson boards, you can configure the service to use either the available CPU or a dedicated GPU.

3. Click **Select model** and select a model from your organization or the registry.
4. Save your config.

### Models available to deploy on the ML Model service

You can also use these publicly available machine learning models with an ML model service:

{{<mlmodels>}}

### Deploy a specific version of an ML model

When you add a model to the ML model service in the app interface, it automatically uses the latest version.
In the ML model service panel, you can change the version in the version dropdown.
Save your config to use your specified version of the ML model.

## How the ML model service works

The service works with models trained inside and outside the Viam app:

- You can [train TFlite](/data-ai/ai/train-tflite/) or [other model frameworks](/data-ai/ai/train/) on data from your machines.
- You can use [ML models](https://app.viam.com/registry?type=ML+Model) from the [Viam Registry](https://app.viam.com/registry).
- You can upload externally trained models from a model file on the [**MODELS** tab](https://app.viam.com/data/models) in the **DATA** section of the Viam app.
- You can use a [model](/data-ai/ai/deploy/#deploy-your-ml-model-on-an-ml-model-service) trained outside the Viam platform whose files are on your machine. See the documentation of the model of ML model service you're using (pick one that supports your model framework) for instructions on this.

On its own the ML model service only runs the model.
After deploying your model, you need to configure an additional service to use the deployed model.
For example, you can configure an [`mlmodel` vision service](/operate/reference/services/vision/) to visualize the inferences your model makes.
Follow our docs to [run inference](/data-ai/ai/run-inference/) to add an `mlmodel` vision service and see inferences.

For other use cases, consider [creating custom functionality with a module](/operate/get-started/other-hardware/).

{{< alert title="Add support for other models" color="tip" >}}
ML models must be designed in particular shapes to work with the `mlmodel` [classification](/operate/reference/services/vision/mlmodel/) or [detection](/operate/reference/services/vision/mlmodel/) model of Viam's [vision service](/operate/reference/services/vision/).
See [ML Model Design](/data-ai/reference/mlmodel-design/) to design a modular ML model service with models that work with vision.
