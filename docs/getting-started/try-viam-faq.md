Try Viam is a way you can try out the platform without setting up any hardware yourself. You can take over a Viam Rover in our robotics lab for 15 minutes to play around!

## How do I make a reservation to take over a Viam Rover?

1. **Click on ‘TRY’ in Viam.** Log into Viam and go to the **[TRY](https://app.viam.com/try)** tab. (If you don’t have an account, it only takes a minute to sign up.)
2. **Click ‘Try Now’ to reserve your slot.** If no one’s using a Viam Rover, you’ll take over immediately. Otherwise, you’ll see an estimated time for the next slot on the TRY tab. If your reserved time slot is more than 30 minutes away, we’ll send you an email confirming your reservation and an email when it’s your turn to use the rover.
3. **Use your reserved Viam Rover on Viam.** See “What happens when my reservation starts?” below for info on how to use the Viam Rover you reserved.

## What happens when my reservation starts?

1. When it is your turn to take over a Viam Rover, the status on the **[TRY](https://app.viam.com/try)** tab will change to **SETTING UP ROBOT**. Once that is complete, the status on the TRY tab will change to **RUNNING**, and you can click “**Try Your Robot**” to access your reserved Viam Rover.
2. Viam creates a location called “Rover Rental” in your organization (if necessary), and adds a Viam Rover with a basic configuration and a random name (e.g., wispy-shape, black-moon, etc.) to your Rover Rental Location.
3. You’ll be able to control a Viam Rover in the Viam robotics lab for 15 minutes. A session timer will be displayed in the top banner. You can see how the rover is configured, write code to control the rover, teleoperate the rover, and more.
