## Getting Started with Viam

When you try Viam for the first time, you'll want to get a feel for how it works. The best way to do that is to take over a Viam Rover in our robotics lab for 15 minutes. You'll be able to drive the robot around, see what it sees, and control its sensors and actuators. You could try things like:

- Teleoperating the rover from wherever you are!
- Writing some code to control the rover
- Using services like computer vision or data management
- See how the rover's components are set up in the intuitive configuration interface

For a limited-time, you can pre-order a Viam Rover [here](http://viam.com/resources/rover?utm_source=slack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=try-viam).

## Getting started with the SDKs

Viam offers SDKs in popular languages which wrap the viam-server [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) APIs and streamline connection, authentication, and encryption against a server.
Using an SDK, you will be able to quickly write code to control and automate your robot(s).

Viam-server exposes gRPC [APIs for robot controls](https://github.com/viamrobotics/api).
It also supports [WebRTC](https://webrtcforthecurious.com/) connectivity and authentication over those APIs.

SDKs make it easier to interface with the robot by providing easy to use, idiomatic interfaces in the programming language of your choice.
You can learn more about the Viam SDKs in the [SDKs as Client](/product-overviews/SDK-as-client).
