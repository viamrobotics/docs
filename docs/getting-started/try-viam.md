## Getting Started with Viam

When you try Viam for the first time, you'll want to get a feel for how it works. The best way to do that is to take over a Viam Rover in our robotics lab for 15 minutes. You'll be able to drive the robot around, see what it sees, and control its sensors and actuators. You could try things like:

- Seeing how easy it is to configure the rover
- Writing some code to control the rover
- Using services like computer vision or data management
- Teleoperate the rover from wherever you are!

## Getting started with the SDKs

Viam offers SDKs in popular languages which wrap the viam-server [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) APIs and streamline connection, authentication, and encryption against a server.
Using the SDK, you will be able to quickly write code to control and automate your robot(s).

Viam-server exposes gRPC [APIs for robot controls](https://github.com/viamrobotics/api).
It also supports [WebRTC](https://webrtcforthecurious.com/) connectivity and authentication over those APIs.

SDKs make it easier to interface with the robot by making direct gRPC calls unnecessary. You can learn more about the Viam SDKs in the [SDKs as Client](/product-overviews/SDK-as-client).

You can find more information about using Viam's SDKs to control the Viam rover in our [Rover Rental Tutorial](Link to Hazal's tutorial).
