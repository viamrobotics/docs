A board is the signal wire hub of a robot, with GPIO pins for transmitting signals between the robot's computer and its other components.
For more information and models supported by the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="rdk" text="RDK" >}}, see [Board Component](/components/board/).

## Supported Models

For configuration information, click on the supported board model name:

| Model             | Description              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| [`esp32`](esp32/) | An ESP32 microcontroller |

## API

The micro-RDK [board API](/components/board/#api) supports only the following client SDK API methods, which operate the same as in the full-featured RDK:

- [`SetPowerMode()`](/components/board/#setpowermode)

For `GPIOPin`s:

- [`Set()`](/components/board/#set)
- [`Get()`](/components/board/#get)
- [`GetPWM()`](/components/board/#getpwm)
- [`SetPWM()`](/components/board/#setpwm)
- [`PWMFreq()`](/components/board/#pwmfreq)
- [`SetPWMFreq()`](/components/board/#setpwmfreq)

For `AnalogReader`s:

- [`Read()`](/components/board/#read)

For `DigitalInterrupt`s:

- [`Value()`](/components/board/#value)
