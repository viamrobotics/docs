The fleet management API allows you to [manage your machine fleet](/fleet/) with code instead of with the graphical interface of the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).
With it you can

- create and manage organizations, locations, and individual machines
- manage permissions and authorization
- create and manage fragments

Fleet management API methods are only available in the Python SDK.

The fleet management API supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To use the Viam fleet management API, you first need to instantiate a [`ViamClient`](https://python.viam.dev/autoapi/viam/app/viam_client/index.html#viam.app.viam_client.ViamClient) and then instantiate an [`AppClient`](https://python.viam.dev/autoapi/viam/app/app_client/index.html#viam.app.app_client.AppClient).
See the following example for reference.

You can create an [API key](/cloud/rbac/#api-keys) on your settings page.

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
import asyncio

from viam.rpc.dial import DialOptions, Credentials
from viam.app.viam_client import ViamClient


async def connect() -> ViamClient:
    dial_options = DialOptions(
      credentials=Credentials(
        type="api-key",
        # Replace "<API-KEY>" (including brackets) with your API key
        payload='<API-KEY>',
      ),
      # Replace "<API-KEY-ID>" (including brackets) with your API key
      # ID
      auth_entity='<API-KEY-ID>'
    )
    return await ViamClient.create_from_dial_options(dial_options)


async def main():

    # Make a ViamClient
    viam_client = await connect()
    # Instantiate an AppClient called "cloud"
    # to run fleet management API methods on
    cloud = viam_client.app_client

    viam_client.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Once you have instantiated an `AppClient`, you can run the following [API methods](#api) against the `AppClient` object (named `fleet` in the examples).

## Find part ID

To copy the ID of your machine {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}}, select the part status dropdown to the right of your machine's location and name on the top of its page and click the copy icon next to **Part ID**:

## Find machine ID

To copy the ID of your {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machine" >}}, click the **...** (Actions) button in the upper-right corner of your machine's page, then click **Copy machine ID**:
