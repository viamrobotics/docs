The power sensor API allows you to give commands to your [power sensor components](/components/power-sensor/) for getting measurements of voltage, current, and power consumption.

The power sensor component supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your machine, go to your machine's page on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

When executed, this sample code will create a connection to your machine as a client.
Once connected, you can control your machine programmatically by adding API method calls as shown in the following examples.

The following examples assume you have a power sensor called `"my_power_sensor"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your power sensor has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Import the power sensor package for the SDK you are using:
