The generic API allows you to give commands to your [generic components](/components/generic/) for running model-specific commands using [`DoCommand`](/appendix/apis/components/generic/#docommand).

The generic component supports the following method:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your machine, go to your machine's page on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

When executed, this sample code will create a connection to your machine as a client.
Then control your machine programmatically by getting your `generic` component from the machine with `FromRobot` and adding API method calls, as shown in the following examples.

The following examples assume you have a board called "my_board" configured as a component of your machine.
If your board has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Be sure to import the generic component package for the SDK you are using:
