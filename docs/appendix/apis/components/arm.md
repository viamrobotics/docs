The arm API allows you to give commands to your [arm components](/components/arm/) for linear motion planning, including self-collision prevention and obstacle avoidance.

The arm component supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your machine, go to your machine's page on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

When executed, this sample code creates a connection to your machine as a client.

The following examples assume you have an arm called `"my_arm"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your arm has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Be sure to import the arm package for the SDK you are using:

# To use move_to_joint_positions:

```

  // To use MoveToJointPositions ("armapi" name optional, but necessary if importing other packages called "v1"):
