The board API allows you to give commands to your [board components](/components/board/) for setting GPIO pins to high or low, setting PWM, and working with analog and digital interrupts.

The board component supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your machine, go to your machine's page on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

When executed, this sample code will create a connection to your machine as a client.
Then control your machine programmatically by getting your `board` component from the machine with `FromRobot` and adding API method calls, as shown in the following examples.

The following examples assume you have a board called "my_board" configured as a component of your machine.
If your board has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Be sure to import the board package for the SDK you are using:
