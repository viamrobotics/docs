The ML training API allows you to get information about and cancel ML training jobs taking place on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).

ML training client API methods are only available in the Python SDK.

## Establish a connection

To use the Viam ML training client API, you first need to instantiate a [`ViamClient`](https://python.viam.dev/autoapi/viam/app/viam_client/index.html#viam.app.viam_client.ViamClient) and then instantiate an [`MLTrainingClient`](https://python.viam.dev/autoapi/viam/app/viam_client/index.html#viam.app.viam_client.ViamClient.ml_training_client).
See the following example for reference.

<!-- After sveltekit migration we should also be able to get a key from the UI-->

Select **Include secret** on the **Code sample** page of the **CONNECT** tab of the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) to obtain your API key and API key ID values.

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
import asyncio

from viam.rpc.dial import DialOptions, Credentials
from viam.app.viam_client import ViamClient


async def connect() -> ViamClient:
    dial_options = DialOptions(
      credentials=Credentials(
        type="api-key",
        # Replace "<API-KEY>" (including brackets) with your machine's API key
        payload='<API-KEY>',
      ),
      # Replace "<API-KEY-ID>" (including brackets) with your machine's
      # API key ID
      auth_entity='<API-KEY-ID>'
    )
    return await ViamClient.create_from_dial_options(dial_options)


async def main():

    # Make a ViamClient
    viam_client = await connect()
    # Instantiate an MLTrainingClient to run ML training client API methods on
    ml_training_client = viam_client.ml_training_client

    viam_client.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Once you have instantiated an `MLTrainingClient`, you can run the following [API methods](#api) against the `MLTrainingClient` object (named `ml_training_client` in the examples).

## API

The ML training client API supports the following methods:
