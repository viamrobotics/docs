You now have the capability to directly [train object detection models](/how-tos/train-deploy-ml/) in addition to image classification models from within the Viam app.

This update allows you to:

- Add labels by drawing bounding boxes around specific objects in your images or a single image.
- Create a curated subset of data for training by filtering images based on labels or tags.

{{% changelog date="2023-05-31" color="added" title="Permissions for organizations in Viam" %}}

Now when you invite collaborators to join your organization, you can assign permissions to members by setting one of these roles:

- **Owner**: These members can see and edit [every tab on the machine page](/cloud/machines/#navigating-the-machine-page), as well as manage users in the app.
  This role is best for those on your team who are actively engineering and building machines.

- **Operator**: These members can only see and use the [remote control tab](/fleet/control/).
  This role is best for those on your team who are teleoperating or remotely controlling machines.

For more information about assigning permissions and collaborating with others on Viam, see [Fleet Management](/fleet/).

{{% changelog date="2023-05-31" color="improved" title="Control RoboClaw motor controllers with the driver" %}}

When using a RoboClaw motor controller without encoders connected to your motors, you now have more direct control over the RoboClaw’s functionality within Viam or through the motor API.

For example, in the Viam app, you can now set **Go For** values for these motors, utilizing a time-based estimation for the number of revolutions.

{{% changelog date="2023-04-25" color="changed" title="Vision service" %}}

{{% alert title="Important: Breaking Change" color="note" %}}

The [vision service](/services/vision/) became more modular in RDK [v0.2.36](https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk/releases/tag/v0.2.36), API [v0.1.118](https://github.com/viamrobotics/api/releases/tag/v0.1.118), and Python SDK [v0.2.18](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-python-sdk/releases/tag/v0.2.18).

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 -->

#### Use individual vision service instances

You need to create **an individual vision service instance** for each detector, classifier, and segmenter model.
You can no longer be able to create one vision service and register all of your detectors, classifiers, and segmenters within it.

{{%expand "Click for details on how to migrate your code." %}}

#### API calls

Change your existing API calls to get the new vision service instance for your detector, classifier, or segmenter model directly from the `VisionClient`:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="New Way" %}}

Change your existing API calls to get the new vision service instance for your detector, classifier, or segmenter model directly from the `VisionClient`:

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
my_object_detector = VisionClient.from_robot(robot, "find_objects")
img = await cam.get_image()
detections = await my_object_detector.get_detections(img)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Old Way" %}}

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
vision = VisionServiceClient.from_robot(robot)
img = await cam.get_image()
detections = await vision.get_detections(img, "find_objects")
```

#### Color detector configurations

#### Add and remove models using the machine config

You must add and remove models using the [machine config](/configure/).
You will no longer be able to add or remove models using the SDKs.

#### Add machine learning vision models to a vision service

The way to add machine learning vision models is changing.
You will need to first register the machine learning model file with the [ML model service](/services/ml/) and then add that registered model to a vision service.

{{% /changelog %}}

{{% changelog date="2023-03-31" color="added" title="Machine learning for image classification models" %}}

You can now [train](/how-tos/train-deploy-ml/) and [deploy](/services/ml/) image classification models with the [data management service](/services/data/) and use your machine's image data directly within Viam.
Additionally, you can upload and use existing [machine learning models](/registry/ml-models/) with your machines.
For more information on using data synced to the cloud to train machine learning models, read [Train a model](/how-tos/train-deploy-ml/).

- [MPU-6050](https://github.com/viam-modules/tdk-invensense): A 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope

{{% /changelog %}}

{{% changelog date="2022-12-28" color="improved" title="Camera performance and reliability" %}}

- Improved server-side logic to choose a mime type based on the camera image type, unless a specified mime type is supplied in the request.
  **The default mime type for color cameras is now JPEG**, which improves the streaming rate across every SDK.
- Added discoverability when a camera reconnects without changing video paths.
  This now triggers the camera discovery process, where previously users would need to manually restart the RDK to reconnect to the camera.

{{% /changelog %}}

{{% changelog date="2022-12-28" color="improved" title="Motion planning with remote components" %}}

The [motion service](/services/motion/) is now agnostic to the networking topology of a machine.

- Kinematic information is now transferred over the robot API.
  This means that the motion service is able to get kinematic information for every component on the machine, regardless of whether it is on a main or remote viam-server.
- Arms are now an input to the motion service.
  This means that the motion service can plan for a machine that has an arm component regardless of whether the arm is connected to a main or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="remote-part" text="remote-part" >}} instance of `viam-server`.

{{% /changelog %}}

{{% changelog date="2022-12-28" color="improved" title="Motion planning path smoothing" %}}

- RRT\* paths now undergo rudimentary smoothing, resulting in improvements to path quality with negligible change to planning performance.
- Plan manager now performs direct interpolation for any solution within some factor of the best score, instead of only in the case where the best inverse kinematics solution could be interpolated.

{{% /changelog %}}

{{% changelog date="2022-12-28" color="improved" title="Data synchronization reliability" %}}

Previously, data synchronization used bidirectional streaming.
Now is uses a simpler unary approach that is more performant on batched unary calls, is easier to load balance, and maintains ordered captures.

{{% /changelog %}}

{{% changelog date="2022-11-28" color="changed" title="Camera configuration" %}}

A new API method parameter, `extra`, allows you to extend {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resource" >}} functionality by implementing the new field according to whatever logic you choose.
`extra` has been added to the following APIs: arm, data management, gripper, input controller, motion, movement sensor, navigation, pose tracker, sensor, SLAM, vision.

{{% alert title="IMPORTANT: Breaking change" color="note" %}}

Users of the Go SDK _must_ update code to specify `extra` in the arguments that pass into each request.

`extra` is an optional parameter in the Python SDK.

`viam-server` now initializes and configures resources in the correct order.
For example, if the SLAM service depends on a LiDAR, it will always initialize the LiDAR before the SLAM service.

If you are using the SLAM service, you now need to specify sensors used by the SLAM service in the `depends_on` field of the SLAM configuration.
Other service configurations are not affected.

{{% changelog date="2022-11-15" color="removed" title="Width and height fields from camera API" %}}

Removed `width` and `height` from the response of the [`GetImage`](/appendix/apis/components/camera/#getimage) method in the camera API.
This does not impact any existing camera models.
If you write a custom camera model, you no longer need to implement the `width` and `height` fields.
