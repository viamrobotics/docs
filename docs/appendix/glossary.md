# Glossary
**Robot:** The configuration and entry point for a computer and components coupled into one logical unit.

**Robot Part:** A single viam-server process belonging to a robot. For example, one robot may be composed of two parts, a Jetson and a Pi. There is generally one robot part per CPU.

**RDK (Robot Development Kit):**

* The official Viam-developed codebase that provides all functionality of an SDK and more. (golang)

* The RDK contains: 

    * Go SDK

    * Various packages and libraries (Motion Planning, Controls, Frame System, SLAM)

    * gRPC Interfaces (protobuf files)

    * gRPC Server Implementations (hardware drivers)

* It can be used as a server. 

    * Can parse and respond to changes in a remote robot configuration file.
 
    * With updates possibly provided by app.viam.com.

    * Initializes resources from a config.

    * Hosts a gRPC server implementing the Viam Robot API.

    * That serves functionality for all registered resources.

* It can be used as a client.

    * To connect to another robot implementing the Viam Robot API.

* Contains different libraries:

    * Motion Planning, Frame System, SLAM, Controls

    * These are used to help implement components/services.

    * Note: Libraries are called “services” ONLY if we expose their functionality in our proto APIs. 

**SDK (Software Development Kit):**

* One per language.

* Can be used as a server for a custom component implementation.

    * Hosts a gRPC server implementing the Viam Robot API.

    * That serves functionality for all registered resources.

* Can be used as a client.

    * To connect to a robot implementing the Viam Robot API.

* Effectively, non-golang versions of RDK’s resource authoring and activation functionality.

**Viam Robot API:**

* The de facto description of how all resources can be communicated with.

* The RDKs/SDKs implement this server side.

* The RDKs/SDKs use this to act as clients.

* Currently expressed as a collection of Protocol Buffer files.

* Does not mandate gRPC as the transport mechanism.

    * However, all RDKs/SDKs written by Viam use gRPC.

**Resource:** An individual, addressable element of a robot (RDK definition).

* Currently split into two types of resources: components and services.

**Component:** A resource that represents an element of hardware in a robot (RDK definition); for example, servo, camera, or arm.

**Service:** A resource that represents an element of software that typically works with components; for example, navigation, base remote control, or metadata service.

**Process:** A bespoke, OS-specific process managed by the RDK to either run once or indefinitely; for example, to run one of Viam's camera servers.

**Resource Config:** The configuration element of either a component or a service. Typically expressed in JSON.

**Robot Config:** The complete configuration of a single robot part. Typically expressed in JSON.

**Model:** A particular implementation of a component type. For example, UR5e is a model of the arm component type.

**Attribute:** A configuration parameter of a resource specific to a model.

**Remote:** A robot part which is controlled by another robot part.

**Base:** A physical, mobile component to which other components are typically mounted. For example, a wheeled chassis and its drivetrain.

**Board:** An IO board connected to a robot part used to express low-level electronics functionality such as GPIO, SPI, or I2C. Examples of boards include Jetson, Raspberry Pi, Numato, or Arduino. Boards like Jetson and Pi run the RDK and can expose the board component itself.

**Frame System:** A hierarchy of frames that are related to one another via coordinate transformations.

**Frame:** A single element of a Frame System. A frame represents a coordinate system that is used to describe position and orientation. The location of a frame is described in relation to its parent frame using rigid transformations rather than in absolute terms.

**Fragment:** A reusable config block typically representing a common resource; for example, viam_gripper. Available across an organization and when used in a config, gets merged (key/value wise) with a specific robot part.

**Remote UI:** Uses the Web JS SDK and provides UI elements to control a robot via WebRTC.

**Packages:** Internal generalizable libraries that are not exposed to the user via proto and can be used by components and services to better implement functionality.  

## Other important non-Viam terminology
**gRPC:** Google Remote Procedure Call. An open source universal RPC system initially developed at Google in 2015. This framework can run in any environment and efficiently connect services across data centers.

**WebRTC:** An open source project which provides applications with real-time communication (RTC) via application programming interfaces (API) allowing powerful voice and video integration.

**Web Sockets:** A computer communications protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. 

**Protocol Buffers (Protobuf):** A free and open-source, language-neutral, cross-platform data format for serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data. 

**SLAM:** Simultaneous localization and mapping. An algorithm that allows a robot to navigate around a space creating or updating a map of the layout as it goes.

**Gantry:** A robot that only uses linear motion to carry out a task; for example, the scaffolding of a 3D printer, which moves the print head around on motorized linear rails.
