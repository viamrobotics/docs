            <td width="120px"><strong>What is it?</strong></td>
            <td>Users can now set the power of the base from the remote control UI. This sets the power percentage being sent to the motors that are driving the base which determines its overall speed.

            <td>
                We added a <code>GetLinearAcceleration</code> method to the movement sensor API. This allows us to represent IMUs that are commonly used by hobbyists using the movement sensor interface.

## New Features

### Custom Modular Resources

<table style="margin-bottom:18px">
    <tbody style="vertical-align:top;">
        <tr>
            <td width="120px"><strong>What is it?</strong></td>
            <td>This new feature allows users to implement their own custom components or component models using our Go SDK.
            We are now working to add support in each of our SDKs so that users can create custom resources in a variety of programming languages.
            Previously, the only way for users to implement custom resources was to use an SDK as a server.
            This meant that a user needed to run a `viam-server` for their custom component and add it to their main part as a remote.
            With custom modular resources, users no longer need to run separate server instances for each custom resource which saves additional network requests.<br/>

{{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
This is a breaking change.
This breaking change affects ALL users who are using the Viam app to configure their robot.
You will need to update to at the latest version of the RDK (V3.0.0) to access your robot via the remote control page.

            <td width="120px"><strong>What is it?</strong></td>
            <td>Users that are implementing their own arms are now able to supply kinematic information via URDF files.
            This is a convenience for our users since URDF files are readily available for common hardware. </td>

## Improvements

### Improved Camera Performance/Reliability

<table style="margin-bottom:18px">
    <tbody style="vertical-align:top;">
        <tr>
            <td width="120px"><strong>What is it?</strong></td>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Improved server-side logic to choose a mime type based on the camera image type, unless a specified mime type is supplied in the request.
                    <strong>The default mime type for color cameras is now JPEG</strong>, which improves the streaming rate across every SDK. </li>
                    <li>Added discoverability when a camera reconnects without changing video paths.
                    This now triggers the camera discovery process, where previously users would need to manually restart the RDK to reconnect to the camera.</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>

### Motion Planning with Remote Components

<table style="margin-bottom:18px">

        <tr>
            <td width="120px"><strong>What is it?</strong></td>

            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kinematic information is now transferred over the robot API.
                    This means that the motion service is able to get kinematic information for every component on the robot, regardless of whether it is on a main or remote `viam-server`.</li>
                    <li>Arms are now an input to the motion service.
                    This means that the motion service can plan for a robot that has an arm component regardless of whether the arm is on a main or remote `viam-server`.</li>
                </ol>
            </td>

<tbody style="vertical-align:top;">

        <td><strong>What does it affect?</strong></td>
        <td><ol><li>Implementation of rudimentary smoothing for RRT* paths, resulting in improvements to path quality, with negligible change to planning performance".</li>
        <li>Changes to plan manager behavior to perform direct interpolation for any solution within some factor of the best score, instead of only in the case where the best IK solution could be interpolated.</li></ol></td>
    </tr>
<tbody>
</table>

### Improved Data Synchronization Reliability

<table style="margin-bottom:18px">
    <tbody style="vertical-align:top;">
        <tr>
            <td width="120px"><strong>What is it?</strong></td>
            <td>We updated how captured data is uploaded from robots to app.viam.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>What does it affect?</strong></td>
            <td>We previously used bidirectional streaming, with the robot streaming sensor readings to the app and the app streaming acknowledgements of progress back to the robot.
            We switched to a simpler unary approach which is more performant on batched unary calls, is easier to load balance, and maintains ordered captures.<br>

            {{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
            This breaking change will NOT affect most users.
            If you have previously captured data on your robot that has not yet been synced, enable syncing to get that data into app.viam before using the new release.

We created this component in response to the common practice of connecting servos to separate hats, such as the <code>PCA9685</code>, rather than connecting directly to the board. Our previous implementation required a direct connection from the servo to the Raspberry Pi.</td>
