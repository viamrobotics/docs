Failure to follow the battery safety guidelines could result in death, personal injury, or property destruction.
{{< /alert >}}

* Power off the Raspberry Pi before changing any electrical connections.
* Do not disassemble or modify the battery on any way. Vibration, puncture, contact with metals, or tampering with the battery can cause it to fail.
* Use caution when working with and using lithium ion batteries as they are very sensitive to charging characteristics and may explode, burn, or cause a fire if misused or mishandled.
* Do not store battery/cell loose or in a pocket, purse, etc. Always use a protective case or box for storage and transport
* When not in use, always store lithium ion batteries in the protective case/box in which batteries were delivered
* Misusing or mishandling lithium ion batteries can pose a serious risk of personal injury, property damage, or death
* Batteries may explode, burn, or cause a fire if misused or mishandled
* Usage of batteries is at your own risk!
* Only use with proper protection circuitry
* Do not short circuit intentionally or unintentionally
* Keep away from metal/conductive objects to prevent short circuiting
* Do not use if pvc wrapper or terminal insulator is damaged or torn
* Do not use if battery is damaged in any way
* Do not over-charge or charge above the maximum voltage rating
* Do not over-discharge or exceed the continuous discharge rating
* Do not modify, disassemble, puncture, cut, crush, or incinerate
* Do not expose to liquids or high temperatures
* Do not solder onto battery, spot weld only
* Do not use force to install or install in reverse/backwards
* Only use within manufacturerâ€™s specification
* Keep away from pets and children
* Always charge in or on a fire-proof surface and never leave batteries charging unattended
* Only use a smart charger designed for this specific type of battery
* Do not mix and match brands and models, old and new, used and unused batteries
* Stop immediately if while charging/storing/using the battery it emits an unusual smell, feels hot, changes color or shape, or appears abnormal in any way
* It is your responsibility to determine that your charger or device is functioning properly
* If exposed to battery electrolyte, flush with water immediately and/or immediately contact a physician or emergency services
