Resources are individual, addressable elements of a robot.

{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="Parts" >}} operate two types of resources: physical {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}} and {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="software services" >}}.
Each part has local resources and can also have {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="remote" text="remote resources">}} from another robot part.
The capabilities of each resource are exposed through the partâ€™s API.
