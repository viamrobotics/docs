Resources are individual, addressable elements of a robot (RDK definition) operated by parts.

Parts operate two types of Resources: physical {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}} and software services. Each part has local resources, and also surfaces remote resources when a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="remote" text="remote">}} is established to another part. The capabilities of each resource are exposed through the partâ€™s API.
