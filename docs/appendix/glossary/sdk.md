Viam provides software development kits (SDKs) to help you write client applications and create support for custom {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="component" >}} types.

The SDKs wrap the `viam-server` {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="grpc" text="gRPC" >}} {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="viam-robot-api" text="Viam Robot API" >}} and streamline connection, authentication, and encryption.

For more information, see [Interact with Resources with Viam's Client SDKs](/build/program/apis/).
