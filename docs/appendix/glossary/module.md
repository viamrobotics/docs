A module provides one or more {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resources" >}}, which add resource types ([components](/components/) and [services](/services/)) or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="models" >}} that are not built into Viam.

You can extend the capabilities of Viam on your robot by [creating your own module](/modular-resources/create/) or [adding an existing module from the Viam registry](/modular-resources/configure/).

For more information see the [modular resource documentation](/modular-resources/).
