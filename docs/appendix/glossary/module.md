A module provides one or more [modular resources](/extend/modular-resources/) (such as [components](/components) or [services](/services)), which add resource types or models that are not built into Viam.

You can extend the capabilities of Viam on your robot by [creating your own module](/extend/modular-resources/create/) or [adding an existing module from the Viam Registry](/extend/modular-resources/configure/).

For more information see the [modular resource documentation](/extend/modular-resources/).
