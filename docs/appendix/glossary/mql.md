MQL is the [MongoDB query language](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/), similar to {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="sql" text="SQL" >}} but specific to the MongoDB document model.

You can use MQL to query tabular data that you have synced to the Viam app using the [data management service](/data/).
