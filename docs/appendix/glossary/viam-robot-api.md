The specification for communication with resources.

- The SDKs implement the Viam Robot API server-side.
- The SDKs use the Viam Robot API to act as clients.

Currently, the Viam Robot API is defined in a collection of Protocol Buffer files.

All SDKs written by Viam use {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="grpc" text="gRPC" >}} but the Viam Robot API itself does not mandate gRPC as the transport mechanism.
