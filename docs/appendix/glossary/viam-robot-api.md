The de facto description of how all resources can be communicated with.

- The RDKs/SDKs implement this server side.
- The RDKs/SDKs use this to act as clients.
- Currently expressed as a collection of Protocol Buffer files.
- Does not mandate gRPC as the transport mechanism.
  - However, all RDKs/SDKs written by Viam use gRPC.
