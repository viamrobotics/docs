A modular resource is a custom {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="model" >}} of a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="component" >}} or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="service" >}} that implements the standardized [API methods](https://docs.viam.com/program/apis/) for that {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resource" >}}.
Modular resources are provided by {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="modules" >}}, and are not built into the RDK.
A modular resource runs in the module process.
This differs from built-in resources, which run as part of `viam-server`.

For more information see the [Modular Resource Documentation](/registry/).
