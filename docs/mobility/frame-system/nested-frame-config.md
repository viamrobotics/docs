Imagine a robotic [arm](/components/arm/) is attached to the actuator (moving part) of a [gantry](/components/gantry/).

Consider the point that the gantry itself is fixed to as the center of the `world`, making the gantry's origin the same as the `world` origin: `(0, 0, 0)`.

Measure from that point to the base of the arm to get the `translation` of the arm.

- Suppose the base of the arm is mounted to the gantry 100mm above the gantry's origin.
- Supply this `translation` and specify the arm's `parent` reference frame as `myGantry`.
- Leave all other frames' `orientation` and `translation` at their default values.

Now, as the gantry moves its actuator, the Frame System will translate both the gantry and the arm's location according to that motion.

To configure your machine following this example:

- Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
- Select **Builder** mode and [configure your gantry](/components/gantry/#supported-models), then [configure your arm](/components/arm/#supported-models).
  If you don't have a physical gantry or arm, you can use their `fake` models.
- Select the **Frame** mode.
- From the left-hand menu, select your gantry.
- Keep the **Parent** frame as `world` and fill in the coordinates for **Translation** (_mm_) and **Orientation** (_deg_) according to the position and orientation of the gantry in relation to the `world` frame's origin.
  For example, considering the point that the gantry itself is fixed to as the center of the `world` you would leave the gantry's frame at the default configuration:
  {{<imgproc src="/mobility/frame-system/frame_card_dyn_gantry.png" resize="300x" style="max-width: 500px" alt="Gantry frame card example for this configuration">}}

- Next, select your arm from the left hand menu.
- Select the **Parent** frame as the gantry, and fill in the coordinates for **Translation** (_mm_) and **Orientation** (_deg_) of the arm in relation to the gantry's origin:

  {{<imgproc src="/mobility/frame-system/frame_card_dyn_arm.png" resize="300x" style="max-width: 500px" alt="Arm frame card example for this configuration">}}

| Parameter | Inclusion | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| `parent`  | **Required** | Default: `world`. The name of the reference frame you want to act as the parent of this frame. |
| `translation` | **Required** | Default: `(0, 0, 0)`. The coordinates that the origin of this component's reference frame has within its parent reference frame. <br> Units: _mm_. |
| `orientation`  | **Required** | Default: `(0, 0, 1), 0`. The [orientation vector](/internals/orientation-vector/) that yields the axes of the component's reference frame when applied as a rotation to the axes of the parent reference frame. <br> Types: **Orientation Vector Degrees** (`ov_degrees`), **Orientation Vector Radians** (`ov_radians`), **Euler Angles** (`euler_angles`), and **Quaternion** (`quaternion`). |
| `geometry`  | Optional | Default: `none`. Collision geometries for defining bounds in the environment of the machine. <br> Units: _mm_ <br> Types: **Sphere** (`sphere`), **Box** (`box`), and **Capsule** (`capsule`). |
