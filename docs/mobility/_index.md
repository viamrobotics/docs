The {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="rdk" text="RDK" >}} includes several built-in services that make it easy to move your robot in intelligent ways, whether moving a single arm, a connected system of gantries and arms, or an entire robot on wheels.

The following services work together to coordinate your robot's movement:

## Frame system

<p>

</p>

The [frame system service](/mobility/frame-system/):

- Allows you to describe the physical relationship between your machine's parts by organizing the machine's {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}} into a tree of reference frames.
- Displays a visualization of that tree of reference frames in <a href="https://app.viam.com">the Viam app</a>.
- Has an API method that allows you to translate a point in the coordinate system of one component (such as a camera) to a point in the coordinate system of another component (such as an arm)
- The motion service uses the tree of reference frames internally to make and execute motion plans while avoiding self-collisions as well as collisions with external objects.

## Motion and navigation

The [motion service](/mobility/motion/) allows you to:

- Create and execute plans to move components to goal positions in the components' own coordinate systems, as well as to move an entire robot on a GPS map or SLAM map.
- Set constraints on the motion plans, such as requiring a component to maintain its orientation throughout the move (for example, an arm holding a cup upright as it moves).

{{<imgproc src="/use-cases/navigation-card.png" class="fill alignleft" style="max-width: 200px" resize="x900" declaredimensions=true alt="A map of part of a city displayed in the Viam app with user-defined waypoints and the location of a robot shown on the map.">}}

The [navigation service](/mobility/navigation/) lets you specify a list of waypoints that a robot should travel through on a GPS map, and delegates to the motion service to create and execute the corresponding sequence of motion plans.

## Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)

{{<gif webm_src="/mobility/slam-map-office.webm" mp4_src="/tutorials/mobility/slam-map-office.mp4" alt="A 2D SLAM map being created in the Viam app. As a red dot representing a rover with a Lidar camera moves around, a map of an office building floor grows." class="alignright" max-width="320px">}}

- The [SLAM service](/mobility/slam/) defines [an API](/mobility/slam/#api) for returning a map of a robot's environment as a _point cloud_, or set of points that represent the occupied space in the environment.
- The platform includes a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="module" >}} that wraps the Cartographer SLAM algorithm.
- Viam's SLAM tools allow you to:
  - Use the Cartographer module to create, update, or do pure localization on maps created either using a live robot or data that was previously captured on a robot using [data capture](/data/capture/).
  - View all maps you have created in your **SLAM library** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
  - Deploy a map from your **SLAM library** onto a robot to use the map with the motion service.

## Get started

To get acquainted with the frame system, [configure the frame system](/mobility/frame-system/frame-config/) for an arm attached to a table.

To create a SLAM map of your home or office, use a mobile [{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="base" text="base" >}}](/components/base/) of your choice along with an RPLIDAR A1 or A3 and the [Cartographer module](/mobility/slam/cartographer/).
