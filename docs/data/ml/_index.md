You can use Viam's built-in machine learning capabilities to [train image classification models](train-model) and [deploy these models to your robots](deploy-model).
You can also [upload and use existing models](upload-model).

To capture and synchronize data to the platform, see [Data Management Service](../../services/data).
To view or export captured data, see [Data Management](../data).
