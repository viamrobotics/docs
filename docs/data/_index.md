Viam's built-in data management service allows you to capture, sync, [view](view/), [label](dataset/), and [export](export/) data from your machines, as well as use [Machine Learning](/ml/) features to enhance your machine's capabilities.
The service is designed for flexibility and efficiency while preventing data loss, data duplication, and other data management issues.

![Data is captured on the machine, uploaded to the cloud, and then deleted off local storage.](/data/data_management.png)

The service has two parts: [data capture](/data/capture/) and [cloud sync](/data/cloud-sync/).

Once you have captured and synced data, you can:

{{< cards >}}
{{% card link="/data/view/" %}}
{{% card link="/data/dataset/" %}}
{{% card link="/data/export/" %}}
{{% card link="/data/query/" %}}
{{% card link="/data/visualize/" %}}
{{< /cards >}}

## Used with

{{< cards >}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/arm/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/board/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/camera/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/encoder/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/gantry/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/motor/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/movement-sensor/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/sensor/">}}
{{< relatedcard link="/components/servo/">}}
{{< /cards >}}

You can configure capture frequency individually for each component.

## Requirements

You must configure data capture and cloud synchronization with the [Data Management Service](/data/) to be able to view, label, and export data.

## API

The data management service supports the following methods:

{{< readfile "/static/include/services/apis/data.md" >}}

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

The following code examples assume that you have a machine configured with a data management service called `"my_data_service"`, and that you add the required code to connect to your machine and import any required packages at the top of your code file.
Go to your machine's **Code sample** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) for boilerplate code to connect to your machine.

{{% /alert %}}

### Sync

{{% alert title="Important" color="tip" %}}

This method is not yet available in the Viam Python SDK.

{{% /alert %}}

Sync data stored on the machine to the cloud.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

**Parameters:**

- `ctx` [(Context)](https://pkg.go.dev/context): A Context carries a deadline, a cancellation signal, and other values across API boundaries.
- `extra` [(map\[string\]interface{})](https://go.dev/blog/maps): Extra options to pass to the underlying RPC call.

**Returns:**

- [(error)](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#error): An error, if one occurred.

For more information, see the [Go SDK Docs](https://pkg.go.dev/go.viam.com/rdk/services/datamanager).

```go {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
data, err := datamanager.FromRobot(robot, "my_data_service")

// Sync data stored on the machine to the cloud.
err := data.Sync(context.Background(), nil)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Use the data management service

To use the data management service, [add the data management service](/data/capture/#add-the-data-management-service) to your machine.
Then, [configure data capture](/data/capture/) and [configure cloud sync](/data/cloud-sync/) as needed.

For a comprehensive tutorial on using data capture and synchronization together with the ML model service, see [Capture Data and Train a Model](/tutorials/services/data-mlmodel-tutorial/).

### View, filter, and export data

Once you have configured data capture and cloud sync, you can [view your data](/data/view/) in the Viam app from the **Data** tab.

You can [filter your data](/data/view/#filter-data) by several categories, including by machine name, location, or timestamp range.
You can filter your data from the **Data** tab in the Viam app or using the Viam Python SDK.

You can also [export](/data/export/) your data as needed.

### Query data

If you have synced tabular data to the Viam app, you can perform {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="sql" text="SQL" >}} or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="mql" text="MQL" >}} queries against that data.
You can chose to:

- Run SQL or MQL queries from the **Query** subtab under the **Data** tab in the Viam app.
- Directly query tabular data from a MQL-compatible client, such as `mongosh`.

See [Query Data](/data/query/) for instructions on using each of these approaches.

Only tabular data, such as [sensor](/components/sensor/) readings, can be queried in this fashion.
To search other types of data, such as images, see [Filter Data](/data/view/#filter-data).

### Train and deploy machine learning

You can use data synced to the cloud to [train machine learning models](/ml/train-model/) and then [deploy these models to your machines](/ml/) from the Viam app.
You can also [upload and use existing models](/ml/upload-model/).

### Permissions

Data management permissions vary between owners and operators.
For more information about who can do what with data, see [Data Permissions](/fleet/rbac/#data-and-machine-learning).
