## Modular resources examples

Detailed, working examples of various types of modular resources are [included with the RDK](https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk/tree/main/examples/customresources).
For a full walk-through of one example, see the [Control an Intermode Rover with CAN Bus and Viam tutorial](/tutorials/custom/controlling-an-intermode-rover-canbus/).

The easiest way to get started is to:

1. Include one of the provided examples in your Viam robot config (see [Using a modular resource with your robot](#use-a-modular-resource-with-your-robot))
2. Control the custom resource on the Viam app's [__CONTROL__ tab](/manage/fleet/#remote-control)
3. Control the custom resource programmatically with a [Viam SDK](/program/sdk-as-client/)
4. Experiment by changing the resource's behavior.
