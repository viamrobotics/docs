After saving your boilerplate code sample and adding control logic with Viam's API methods, run your program to control your Viam-connected robot.
Do this by running a command to execute the program in the terminal of a machine with the appropriate programming language and Viam SDK installed.

For example:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```sh {id="terminal-prompt" class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
python3 ~/myCode/myViamFile.py
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```sh {id="terminal-prompt" class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
go run ~/myCode/myViamFile.py
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="TypeScript" %}}

For an example, see [this execution demo.](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-typescript-sdk/tree/main/examples/vanilla)

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Run Code Externally

If you are connecting to your robot through an external signaling address, as is the case in the boilerplate code samples generated by the Viam app, you can execute your control code on any computer.
The control logic will be executed on the robot, as long as both computers are able to establish a network connection.

### Run Code Locally

If you need to run [PID control loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) or other on-robot code, you can run control code on the same board that is running `viam-server`.

To ensure intermittent internet connectivity does not interfere with the code's execution, there are some special steps you need to follow:

{{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
Currently, this only works with Python code which is running on the same board that `viam-server` is running on.
{{< /alert >}}

1. Change the `connect()` method to disable {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="webrtc" >}} and add the auth_entity in the DialOptions and use `localhost:8080`:

    ```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers" data-line="5"}
    async def connect():
      creds = Credentials(type='robot-location-secret', payload=PAYLOAD_SECRET)
      opts = RobotClient.Options(
        refresh_interval=0,
        dial_options=DialOptions(
            credentials=creds,
            disable_webrtc=True,
            auth_entity=ROBOT_NAME
        )
      )
      return await RobotClient.at_address('localhost:8080', opts)
    ```

2. Replace the `ROBOT_NAME` with your robot's Viam cloud address and the `PAYLOAD_SECRET` with your robot secret.
   Your localhost can now make a secure connection to `viam-server` locally.
   SSL will now check the server hostname against the `auth_entity` required by {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="grpc" >}} from the `auth_entity` dial options.

   This ensures that you can send commands to the robot through localhost without internet connectivity.
   Note that all commands will be sent using {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="grpc" >}} only without {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="webrtc" >}}.
