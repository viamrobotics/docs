The `viam-server` executable runs on a computer and manages hardware, software, and data for a machine.
`viam-server` is built from the open-source [Robot Development Kit (RDK)](https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk).
If you are working with microcontrollers, [`viam-micro-server`](/architecture/viam-micro-server/) is a lightweight version of `viam-server` which can run on resource-limited embedded systems that cannot run the fully-featured `viam-server`.

To use Viam with a machine, you create a configuration specifying which hardware and software the machine consists of.
`viam-server` then manages and runs the drivers for the configured {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}}.

Overall, _viam-server_ manages:

- [Communication](#communication)
- [Dependency management](#dependency-management)
- [Start-up](#start-up)
- [Reconfiguration](#reconfiguration)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Shutdown](#shutdown)

## Communication

`viam-server` handles all {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="grpc" text="gRPC" >}} and {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="webrtc" >}} communication for connecting machines to the cloud or for connecting to other parts of your machine.

## Dependency management

`viam-server` handles dependency management between resources.

## Start-up

`viam-server` ensures that any configured {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="modules" >}}, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="built-in resources" >}} and {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resources" >}}, and processes are loaded on startup.

After start-up, `viam-server` manages:

- the configured processes,
- the connections to hardware,
- the running services, and
- the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="modules" >}} that provide the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resources" >}}.

### Reconfiguration

When you or your collaborators change the configuration of a machine in the Viam app, `viam-server` automatically synchronizes the configuration to your machine and updates the running resources within 15 seconds.
This means you can add, modify, and remove a modular resource instance from a running machine.

You can see configuration changes made by yourself or by your collaborators by selecting **History** on the right side of your machine part's card on the **CONFIGURE** tab.
You can also revert to an earlier configuration from the History tab.

### Logging

Log messages written appear under the [**LOGS** tab](/cloud/machines/#logs) for the machine running the module.

### Shutdown

During machine shutdown, `viam-server` handles modular resource instances similarly to built-in resource instances - it signals them for shutdown in topological (dependency) order.
