Fragments are a way of sharing and managing identical {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resource" >}} configuration files across multiple robots.
For example, if you have multiple robots with the same hardware, wired the same way, you can create and share a fragment and add it to any number of robots.
When changes are made to the fragment, those changes are automatically carried to all robots that include the fragment in their config.

You can add a fragment to a robot's config and also add other configuration outside the fragment.
For example, if you have multiple identical rovers but one has an arm attached, you can add the rover configuration fragment (including the motors and base components), and then configure the arm on just that one rover.

To add a fragment to a robot:

- Go to the **FRAGMENTS** sub-tab of your robot's **CONFIG** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
- Look through the list of available fragments and click **ADD** next to any fragments you want to add to your robot.
- Click **Save Config** at the bottom of the screen.

The components included in the fragment appear inside a read-only fragment section in the **COMPONENTS** sub-tab.

In the `Raw JSON` configuration, you will see the fragment ID in the `fragments` section:

```json
{
  "components": [ ],
  "fragments": [
    "3e8e0e1c-f515-4eac-8307-b6c9de7cfb84"
  ]
}
```

To create your own fragment, go to [app.viam.com/fragments](https://app.viam.com/fragments).

For an example of adding a fragment to a robot, see the [Viam Rover fragment tutorial](/try-viam/rover-resources/rover-tutorial-fragments/).
