[Modular resources](/program/extend/modular-resources/) are a way to add resource types or models that are not built into Viam.

To add a modular resource as a component or service of your robot, configure a module per the [modular resource documentation](/program/extend/modular-resources/#add-a-module-to-your-robot-configuration).
