Viam provides built-in support for a variety of {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}}:

- Various types of hardware {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}}.
- High-level functionality exposed as {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="services" >}}.

If the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="component" >}} or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="service" >}} you want to use for your project is not natively supported, you can [use _modular resources_ from the Viam Registry](#the-viam-registry) or [create your own modular resources](#create-your-own-modular-resources).
You configure and manage modular resources the same way as built-in resources and use the same [standardized APIs](/program/apis/).

## The Viam Registry

The [Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry) is the central place where you can browse modular resources that add capabilities to your smart machine beyond what is built-in to `viam-server`.
You can see details about each module in the [Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry) on its module details page.

You can search the available modular resources from the Viam Registry here:

<div id="searchbox"></div>
<p>
<div id="searchstats"></div></p>
<div class="mr-component" id="">
  <div class="modellistheader">
    <div class="type">API</div>
    <div class="name">Model</div>
    <div>Description</div>
  </div>
<div id="hits" class="modellist">
</div>
<div id="pagination"></div>
</div>

To use a modular resource from the registry, add it from your robot's **Configuration** tab in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/), using the **Create component** button.

## Create Your Own Modular Resources

If none of the existing modular resources in the Viam registry support your use case, you can also create your own modular resources:

- **Implement a custom component**: You can write a driver for an unsupported {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="component" >}} by implementing the corresponding component API.

- **Implement a custom service**: You can implement your own algorithm or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="model" text="model" >}} against a corresponding service API or use custom algorithm or data models when working with services such as [SLAM](/services/slam/), [vision](/services/vision/), or [motion planning](/services/motion/).

- **Implement fully custom logic**: If your robot runs specialty or proprietary logic, and you want to use Viam to manage and control that logic, such as when managing a software development lifecycle, you can implement your own custom logic by wrapping the [generic API](/components/generic/).

To create a new modular resource:

1. [Code a new resource model](/modular-resources/create/) by implementing all methods for the component's or services's [standardized APIs](/program/apis/).
1. Package your modular resource or modular resources as a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="module" >}} and [upload the module to the Viam registry](/modular-resources/upload/) to make it available for deployment to robots.
   You can upload _private_ modules for your [organization](/manage/fleet/organizations/) or _public_ modules.
1. Once you have uploaded your module to the registry, you can [deploy and configure the module](/modular-resources/configure/) from [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).
   You can test your added resource using the [Control tab](/manage/fleet/#remote-control) and [program](/program/) it with Viam's Go or Python SDKs.

Some use cases may require you to extend the standardized API definitions or deploy custom components using a server on a remote part.
