The [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/) is a web UI for managing and building robots.

## Create Account and Log In

To get started on the Viam app, you must log in as an authorized user.
Viam support sign up using Google, GitHub, Apple, and email.

If you haven't created an account yet, click **Sign Up** to create a new account using your prefered Single Sign On method or your email address and a password.
If you already have an account, click **Log In** to log in using your Single Sign On credentials or your email address and password.

## Manage

You do not have to use the app to use Viam's platform to build your robot, but it has several key features to help you get started managing your robots, including configuring robots with more complicated architecture like sub-parts or remotes:

{{< cards >}}
{{% card link="/platform/build/configure/configuration" %}}
{{% card link="/platform/fleet" %}}
{{% card link="/platform/data" %}}
{{% card link="/platform/ml" %}}
{{% card link="/platform/build/configure/parts-and-remotes" %}}
{{< /cards >}}

<br>

You can also manage and control your robots from the command line with our CLI:

{{< cards >}}
{{% card link="/platform/fleet/cli" %}}
{{< /cards >}}

## Sign Out

To log out or sign out of the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/), click on your profile icon in the upper right corner of your browser window.
Click **Sign out** to sign out of accessing all organizations, locations, and robots your credentials manage.
