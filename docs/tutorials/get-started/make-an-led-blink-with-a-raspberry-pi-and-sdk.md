In this post, you will be introduced to the basics of programming hardware by using either the [Viam Python SDK](https://python.viam.dev/) or the [Viam Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/go.viam.com/rdk/robot/client#section-readme) to make an LED blink.
This will allow you to write code to make an LED connected to the GPIO of a Raspberry Pi blink on and off.
This tutorial is a good introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Go](https://go.dev/) programming languages, and developing custom software for robots.

This is part 2 of Viam's Intro to Robotics series.
If you haven't completed [Part 1](/tutorials/get-started/make-an-led-blink-with-the-viam-app/), be sure to go back and complete that before starting on this tutorial.
You should have already set up [your Raspberry Pi](/installation/prepare/rpi-setup), [connected to the Viam app and set up `viam-server`](/installation#install-viam-server), and built your circuit before proceeding.

For reference, the circuit you are building for this tutorial looks like this:

### How to install a Viam SDK

In this step, you are going to install either the [Viam Python SDK](https://python.viam.dev/) (Software Development Kit) or the [Viam Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/go.viam.com/rdk/robot/client#section-readme) on your local computer.

### How to connect your robot to the Viam SDK

The easiest way to get started writing an application with Viam is to navigate to the [robot page on the Viam App](https://app.viam.com/robots), select the **CODE SAMPLE** tab, and copy the boilerplate code from the section labeled **Python SDK** or **Go SDK**.
These code snippets import all the necessary libraries and set up a connection with the Viam app in the cloud.
Next, paste that boilerplate code from the **CODE SAMPLE** tab of the Viam app into a file named <file>blink.py</file> or <file>blink.go</file> file in your code editor, and save your file.

You can now run the code.
Doing so will ensure that the Viam SDK is properly installed and that the `viam-server` instance on your robot is live.

You can run your code by typing the following into the terminal:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```bash
python3 blink.py
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```bash
go run blink.go
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

If you successfully configured your robot and it is able to connect to the Viam app, you should see something like this printed to the terminal after running your program.
What you see here is a list of the various resources, components, and services that have been configured to your robot in the Viam app.

<img src="../../img/make-an-led-blink-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-sdk/image4.png" alt="A screenshot from the Visual Studio Code command line that prints the output of print(robot.resource_names) when your Raspberry Pi has correctly connected and initialized with the Viam app. The output is an array of resources that have been pulled from the Viam app. Some of these are the Vision Service, Data Manager, and Board." width="500">

### How to make an LED Blink with the Viam SDKs

The first thing you need to do is import the [Board component](/components/board/) from the Viam SDK.
This component represents a physical general-purpose board that contains GPIO pins.
We will need this component in order to interact with the GPIO pins on our Raspberry Pi.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

At the top of your <file>blink.py</file> file, add the following to the import statement without removing any of the other imports

```python
from viam.components.board import Board
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

In <file>blink.go</file>, and inside the `import` block at the top of the file, add the following to the import statements without removing any of the other imports:

```go {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
  "go.viam.com/rdk/components/board"
)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Next, you will need to initialize the Raspberry Pi board, and you will need to tell Viam which GPIO pin your LED is on.
At the bottom of the <code>main()</code> function, paste the following:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
# Initialize the board and the LED on pin 8
local = Board.from_robot(robot, 'local')
led = await local.gpio_pin_by_name('8')
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```go {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
// Initialize the board
myBoard, err := board.FromRobot(robot, "myBoard")
if err != nil {
    logger.Fatalf("could not get board: %v", err)
}

// Initialize the board's GPIO pin and name it "led"
led, err := myBoard.GPIOPinByName("8")
if err != nil {
    logger.Fatalf("could not get led: %v", err)
}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Now that we have our board, and LED initialized, let's create an infinite loop that will blink the LED on and off.
Within the `main` function, you can add the code to create an infinite loop, you can remove the line to close out the connection to your robot, since the infinite loop will never hit that line.
Your completed `main` function should look like this:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```python {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
async def main():
    robot = await connect()

    print('Resources:')
    print(robot.resource_names)

    # Initialize the board and the LED on pin 8
    local = Board.from_robot(robot, 'local')
    led = await local.gpio_pin_by_name('8')

    # Create an infinite loop that will blink the LED on and off
    while (True):
        # When True, sets the LED pin to high/on.
        await led.set(True)
        print('LED is on')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

        # When False, sets the pin to low/off.
        await led.set(False)
        print('LED is off')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```go {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
func main() {
  logger := golog.NewDevelopmentLogger("client")
  robot, err := client.New(
      context.Background(),
      "[ADD YOUR ROBOT ADDRESS HERE. YOU CAN FIND THIS ON THE CONNECT TAB OF THE VIAM APP]",
      logger,
      client.WithDialOptions(rpc.WithCredentials(rpc.Credentials{
          Type:    utils.CredentialsTypeRobotLocationSecret,
          Payload: "[PLEASE ADD YOUR SECRET HERE. YOU CAN FIND THIS ON THE CONNECT TAB OF THE VIAM APP]",
      })),
  )
  if err != nil {
      logger.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer robot.Close(context.Background())
  logger.Info("Resources:")
  logger.Info(robot.ResourceNames())

  // Initialize the board
  myBoard, err := board.FromRobot(robot, "myBoard")
  if err != nil {
    logger.Fatalf("could not get board: %v", err)
  }
  // Initialize the board's GPIO pin and name it "led"
  led, err := myBoard.GPIOPinByName("8")
  if err != nil {
    logger.Fatalf("could not get led: %v", err)
  }

  //   Infinite loop that will blink the LED on and off.
  for {
    // When True, sets the LED pin to high/on.
    err = led.Set(context.Background(), true, nil)
    if err != nil {
      logger.Fatalf("could not set led to on: %v", err)
    }
    fmt.Println("LED is on")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

    // When False, sets the pin to low/off.
    err = led.Set(context.Background(), false, nil)
    if err != nil {
      logger.Fatalf("could not set led to off: %v", err)
    }
    fmt.Println("LED is off")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
  }
}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

You can run your code again by typing the following into the terminal:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```bash
python3 blink.py
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```bash
go run blink.go
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

And, if all goes well, you should see your LED blinking on and off again every second!

You can exit this program by pressing **CTRL + C** in your terminal window.
