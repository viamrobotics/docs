Building a useful robot doesn't have to require complicated code or expensive equipment.
With a Raspberry Pi and some cheap, basic hardware, you can keep your plants healthy and happy from anywhere in the world!

Follow this tutorial to learn how to set up an automatic plant watering system:

1. [Complete the physical assembly and wiring](#set-up-your-plant-watering-robot).
2. [Create and connect to the robot, and configure your robot's components](#configure-the-components-of-your-robot-in-the-viam-app).
3. [Configure the ADC as a module from the registry](#configure-the-adc-as-a-module-from-the-registry).
4. [Write code utilizing the Viam Python SDK to control the plant watering robot](#add-python-control-code).

{{<youtube embed_url="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q6UuUKJpDn0?start=877">}}

You can also follow a simplified version of this tutorial in this video: it eliminates the need for the ADC and the breadboard, instead using the digital pin of the moisture sensor to get “high” and “low” readings and to turn a relay on and off.
You can start with this simple version and then add the ADC to make your machine more accurate!

The tutorial uses the following hardware, but you can adjust it as needed:

- A Raspberry Pi 3B or 4B with SD card and [5V USB power supply](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Supply-Adapter-Listed/dp/B00MARDJZ4)
- A [resistive soil moisture sensor](https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Sensitivity-Moisture-Watering-Manager/dp/B07QXZC8TQ)
- A [5V mini water pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TGK9N5Q/) with clear vinyl tube
- A [MCP3008 ADC](https://a.co/d/csRaIHE)
- A [one channel relay switch](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Channel-optocoupler-Support-Trigger/dp/B00LW15A4W/)
- A [breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Raspberry-Breadboard-solderless-Circuit/dp/B07ZYR7R8X)
- Assorted [breadboard jumper wires](https://www.amazon.com/EDGELEC-Breadboard-Optional-Assorted-Multicolored/dp/B07GD2BWPY/), including wires with [alligator clips](https://www.amazon.com/Goupchn-Alligator-Breadboard-Flexible-Electrical/dp/B08M5P6LHR/)
- A planter box or flower pot
- A water container
- A screwdriver

Before starting this tutorial, follow the [Raspberry Pi Setup Guide](/get-started/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/) to prepare your Pi to run `viam-server`.
Connect your Pi to its power supply to power it on.
Make sure your Pi is flashed with a Viam-compatible operating system, and that you are able to SSH into it.

## Set up your plant watering robot

Before programming the Pi to make the plant watering robot functional, you need to physically set up the plant watering robot by wiring the different components together.
You will set up the robot to receive signals from the resistive soil moisture sensor and signal to the pump when it is time to pump water from the water's container to the plant's container.

### Full wiring diagram

Refer back to this diagram as you complete the steps to wire your hardware.

![The full wiring diagram for all the hardware for the Plant Watering Robot.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/full-wiring.png)

### Wire your ADC

The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts the resistive soil moisture sensor's analog readings to digital signals that can be processed by your Pi, which expects digital signals to come to it through its GPIO pins.

Start by wiring your ADC to your Raspberry Pi board.

You can find a Raspberry Pi pinout diagram at [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz).
Reference the following pinout diagram for your MCP3008 analog-to-digital converter:

![Pinout diagram for the ADC.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/adc-pinout.png)

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
The half circle shown in the pinout diagram above should be physically present on your ADC.
Use this to orient the ADC to determine the location to insert your wires.
{{% /alert %}}

Insert the MCP3008 into your breadboard so that it bridges both sides of the divide.
Then, use the rows on the side of your MCP3008's pins and the GPIO pins on your Pi to connect the pins with wires as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| MCP3008 ADC Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| VDD | 5V |
| VREF | 5V |
| AGND | GND |
| DGND | GND |
| CLK | SCLK |
| DOUT | MISO |
| DIN | MOSI |
| CS/SHDN | 24GPIO8 |

Use an additional wire to wire Raspberry Pi [pin 4 (a 5 volt power pin)](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/5v_power) to the power rail of the breadboard (the red plus sign column).
This brings the 5V power output from the Raspberry Pi to the ADC and the sensor.

### Wire your resistive soil moisture sensor

Next, wire your [resistive soil moisture sensor](https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Sensitivity-Moisture-Watering-Manager/dp/B07QXZC8TQ) to your Pi and ADC.

Reference this diagram of the blue module part of the sensor:

![Pinout diagram for the resistive soil moisture sensor.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/moisture-sensor-pinout.png)

Start by connecting the female jumper wires at the end of the sensor prongs to the blue module where the diagram shown above is labeled "Connect with Probe."
Be careful of the positive and negative sides, and make sure to match them correctly.

Then, wire the rest of the pins on the module to the Pi and ADC as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Pi | ADC |
|--|--|
|<table> <tr><th>Moisture Sensor Pin</th><th>Raspberry Pi Pin</th></tr><tr><td>VCC</td><td>5V on the power rail</td></tr><tr><td>GND</td><td>GND</td></tr> </table>| <table> <tr><th>Moisture Sensor Pin</th><th>MCP3008 ADC Pin</th></tr><tr><td>A0 (Analog Signal Output)</td><td>CH0</td></tr> </table>|

Put the soil moisture sensor inside of the container holding your plant.

### Wire your pump

Now, wire and power your pump [motor](/components/motor/) and relay module to complete your hardware setup:

1. Attach an [alligator wire clip](https://www.amazon.com/Goupchn-Alligator-Breadboard-Flexible-Electrical/dp/B08M5P6LHR/) to your 5V pump motor's positive wire, and connect it to the NO pin on relay module.
   NO stands for normally open, which will keep the circuit open unless the pin is triggered.
2. Attach another [alligator wire clip](https://www.amazon.com/Goupchn-Alligator-Breadboard-Flexible-Electrical/dp/B08M5P6LHR/) to your 5V pump motor's negative wire, and connect it to [pin 39 (ground)](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/ground) on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Connect the COM (common) pin on the relay to [pin 1 (3.3V)](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/3v3_power) on the Pi.
4. Connect the 5V pin on the relay to [pin 2 (5V)](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/5v_power) on the Pi.
5. Connect the GND pin on the relay to [pin 14 (ground)](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/ground) on the Pi.
6. Connect the IN pin on the relay to the [pin 8 (GPIO 14)](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin8_gpio14) on the Pi.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

To complete the steps, insert the ends of the jumper wires into the pin gates on the relay module and tighten the screws on these gates with your screwdriver to close the wires inside.

## Program your plant watering robot

{{<gif webm_src="/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/plant-watering-video.webm" mp4_src="/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/plant-watering-video.mp4" alt="The plant watering robot on a white desk. Camera goes up to the watering tube and pulls it out, showing the drip.">}}

### Enable SPI on your Pi

Now that you have wired your ADC and moisture sensor, make sure that the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is enabled on your Pi.
Enabling this protocol is necessary to allow the Pi to communicate with the moisture sensor peripheral.

SSH into your Pi and run the following command:

```shell
sudo raspi-config
```

Once the `raspi-config` interface is open, navigate to **Interface Options**:

![Raspi-config Tool interface with Interface Options selected.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/interface-options.png)

Then, select **SPI**:

![Raspi-config Tool interface with SPI selected.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/spi.png)

Now, select **Yes** to enable SPI:

![Raspi-config Tool interface with Yes selected for SPI enablement.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/spi-enabled.png)

Finally, select **Finish**.
Restart your Pi using `sudo reboot` to make these changes take effect.

### Test your soil moisture readings on your Pi

Next, install the Adafruit ADC library [`Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP3xxx`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP3xxx/) on your Pi.

Before installation, make sure any packages on your Pi are up to date:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Make sure you have `pip` installed for Python 3:

```shell
pip --version
```

If not, run the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Run the following command while connected to your Pi with SSH to install [`Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP3xxx`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP3xxx/):

```shell
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-mcp3xxx
```

Create a new directory for your plant watering robot's files and navigate to this directory in your terminal session.
For example, run the following commands:

```shell
mkdir plant-watering-robot
cd plant-watering-robot
```

After navigating to this directory, create a new Python file called <file>adctesting.py</file> and open up the file.
For example, run the following commands:

```shell
touch adctesting.py
nano adctesting.py
```

Now, add the following Python code to <file>adctesting.py</file> to test reading values from your resistive soil moisture sensor through your MCP3008 ADC:

```python
import time
import busio
import digitalio
import board
import adafruit_mcp3xxx.mcp3008 as MCP
from adafruit_mcp3xxx.analog_in import AnalogIn

# Create the SPI bus
spi = busio.SPI(clock=board.SCK, MISO=board.MISO, MOSI=board.MOSI)

# Create the cs (chip select)
cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D8)

# Create the MCP3008 object
mcp = MCP.MCP3008(spi, cs)

# Create an analog input channel on Pin 0
chan = AnalogIn(mcp, MCP.P0)

print('Reading MCP3008 values, press Ctrl-C to quit...')
while True:
    print('Raw ADC Value: ', chan.value)
    time.sleep(1)
```

Run the code as follows:

```shell
sudo python3 adctesting.py
```

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

If running this code returns `ImportError: No module named busio`, try again after reinstalling `adafruit-blinka`:

```shell
sudo pip3 install --force-reinstall adafruit-blinka
```

{{% /alert %}}

Now, you should see the moisture sensor values outputted by the MCP3008.

Test your sensor by putting it in air, water, and different soils to see how the values change to determine your baseline for wet and dry values.

### Configure the components of your robot in the Viam app

Follow [this guide](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server) to install `viam-server` on your Pi, create a new machine, and connect to it on [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).

Then, navigate to your new machine's page in the app and click on the **Config** tab.

First, add your Pi as a [board component](/components/board/) by creating a new component with **type** `board` and **model** `pi`:

{{< tabs name="Configure an Pi Board" >}}
{{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

![Creation of a pi board in the Viam app config builder.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/pi-board-config-builder.png)

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Raw JSON" %}}

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "local",
      "model": "pi",
      "type": "board",
      "namespace": "rdk",
      "attributes": {},
      "depends_on": []
    } // Motor JSON ...
  ]
}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Then, add your pump as a [motor component](/components/motor/) by adding a new component with **type** `motor` and **model** `gpio`.

Set the motor's attributes **Max RPM** to `1000` and **PWM** to `8 GPIO 14` (the board and GPIO pin that you wired the relay's IN to).

{{< tabs name="Configure an Pump Motor" >}}
{{% tab name="Config Builder" %}}

![Creation of a pump motor in the Viam app config builder.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/pump-motor-config-builder.png)

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Raw JSON" %}}

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
// Board JSON ... },
{
  "name": "water-pump",
  "model": "gpio",
  "type": "motor",
  "namespace": "rdk",
  "attributes": {
    "pins": {
      "a": "",
      "b": "",
      "dir": "",
      "pwm": "8"
    },
    "board": "local",
    "max_rpm": 1000
  },
  "depends_on": []
}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Click **Save config**.

Now, if you navigate to your machine's **Control** tab, you should be able to control the motor by setting the power and direction of rotation and clicking the **RUN** button:

![Creation of a pump motor in the Viam app config builder.](/tutorials/plant-watering-pi/pump-motor-control.png)

#### Configure the ADC as a module from the registry

_Resources_ refer to the different [components](/components/) and [services](/services/) Viam provides for robots to use.
_Components_ refer to types of hardware, and each component's built-in `models` support the most common models of this hardware.
For example, the [sensor component](/components/sensor/) has an `ultrasonic` model built in for the ubiquitous [ultrasonic sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569).

However, there are many different types of sensors used for sensing different things across the [Internet of Things](https://medium.com/@siddharth.parakh/the-complete-list-of-types-of-sensors-used-in-iot-63b4003ab6b3).
Although the resistive soil moisture sensor is not currently one of Viam's built-in models, you can add an analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) as a module and use it to get readings from the moisture sensor.

A _module_ provides one or more {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resources" >}}, which add resource types ([components](/components/) and [services](/services/)) or models that are not built into Viam.
A module can be added to your robot from the Viam registry.

The [Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry) allows hardware and software engineers to collaborate on their robotics projects by writing and sharing custom modules with each other.
You can add a module from the Viam registry directly from your robot’s Configuration tab in the Viam app, using the + Create component button.

Add the mcp300x-adc-sensor module to your robot in 3 steps:

1. Go to your machine's **Config** tab.
   Select **Create component**.
2. Search mcp300x.
   Click **Add module**.
3. Give your module a name of your choice, and click **Create** to add this module to your machine.
4. Find your module's card on the **Config** page.
   In **Attributes**, add the necessary attributes as `"channel_map"` and `"sensor_pin"`.
   For example, if you have a moisture sensor on channel 0, and your `sensor_pin` is 8, your configuration should look like this:

   ```json
   {
     "channel_map": {
       "moisture": 0
     },
     "sensor_pin": 8
   }
   ```

Save your config.

This module allows you to get multiple readings at the same time from different channels of the ADC sensor.
If you wire and configure another sensor, such as a temperature sensor on channel 1, you can add the sensor to the `"channel_map"` and get a reading from it.

{{< alert title="Info" color="info" >}}
If you would like to see how the module works, you can find its code on [GitHub](https://github.com/viam-labs/mcp300x-adc-sensor).
{{< /alert >}}

Now that you have set up your robot and are able to control your motor, you can put the suction tube of your pump into the water cup, and the output tube into the plant!

### Add Python control code

Follow these instructions to start working on your Python control code:

1. Navigate to your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), and click on the **Code sample** tab.
2. Select **Python** as the language.
3. Click **Copy** to copy the generated code sample, which establishes a connection with your robot when run.

   {{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

4. Paste this code sample into a new file in the `plant-watering-robot` directory you created on your Pi.
5. Name the file <file>plant-watering-robot.py</file>, and save it.

For example, run the following commands on your Pi to create and open the file:

```shell
cd plant-watering-robot
touch plant-watering-robot.py
nano plant-watering-robot.py
```

Now, you can add code into <file>plant-watering-robot.py</file> to write the logic that defines your plant watering system.

To start, add your system logic code into the `main()` function of the program.
Use the Viam [motor](/components/motor/#api) and [sensor](/components/sensor/#control-your-sensor-with-viams-client-sdk-libraries) API methods.

You can get your components from the robot like this:

```python
# Note that this name, `sensor`, is defined when you add the module
sensor = Sensor.from_robot(robot=robot, name='sensor')
water_pump = Motor.from_robot(robot=robot, name='water-pump')
```

And you can add your system logic to run continuously like this:

```python
while True:

    # Get the moisture sensor's readings
    readings = await sensor.get_readings()
    soil_moisture = readings.get('moisture')

    # Calculate average moisture reading from the list of readings, to account
    # for outliers
    avg_moisture = sum(soil_moisture) / len(soil_moisture)

    # If the average moisture reading is greater than 60000, trigger pump
    # watering
    if (avg_moisture > 60000):
        print('this plant is too thirsty! giving it more water')

        # Run the water pump for 100 rev. at 1000 rpm
        await water_pump.go_for(rpm=1000, revolutions=100)

        # Wait 60 seconds so that the water can soak into the soil a bit before
        # trying to water again
        print('waiting a little bit for water to soak in')
        time.sleep(60)
```

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
Make sure to import `time` at the beginning of your version of <file>plant-watering-robot.py</file> to be able to use `sleep()`!
Also, make sure to import `viam.components.sensor`.
{{% /alert %}}

See the motor component's [API documentation](/components/motor/#gofor) for more information about `water_pump.go_for()`.

Save your <file>plant-watering-robot.py</file> program with this logic added in, and then run it on your Pi like this:

```shell
sudo python3 plant-watering-robot.py
```

To tinker this example code to work best for you, determine at what [analog value from the soil moisture readings](#test-your-soil-moisture-readings-on-your-pi) you want to water your plant, as your thirsty plant's average moisture reading might differ from our example value of `60000`.
Also, consider how often you would like to check the moisture levels of the plant, and how long the plant should be watered.

## Next steps

Now that you have created your automatic plant watering system with a resistive soil moisture sensor, you can easily use Viam to automate other aspects of your garden.
For example, you can use a [light sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Sensor-Module-Raspberry-Integrated-Circuits/dp/B07L15M5JG) or a [temperature sensor](https://www.amazon.com/KY-011-Cathode-Arduino-Starter-2-color/dp/B07869PKKF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=arduino+two+color+led+module&qid=1556591832&s=gateway&sr=8-2&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=murraynet-20&linkId=c36cd98be29498a9883b656c7011b6bb&language=en_US), and get readings from other channels of the MCP3008!
If you build something based on this please share it in our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/viam) - we'd love to see it.
