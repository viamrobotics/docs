The purpose of this tutorial is to add a Bluetooth gamepad input controller to a SCUTTLE Robot being controlled with a Raspberry Pi having the Raspian OS 64-bit Lite and Viam Server installed.
Now you can try to drive the SCUTTLE around like an RC car using the EasySMX ESM-9101 Wireless Controller.

## Prerequisites

* A pre-configured and controllable (via keyboard on the Viam app ([https://app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com)) Scuttle Robot.
Refer to the [Setting up a Scuttle with Viam](../scuttlebot/) tutorial, if necessary.

* Connection to the Viam app
* EasySMX ESM-9101 Wireless Controller

The following video demonstrates controlling a SCUTTLE Robot using a bluetooth gamepad:<br>

## Adding the Controller to the SCUTTLE's Config

To add this controller to the robotâ€™s config, from the Viam app ([https://app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com)), click on our old friend, **New COMPONENT**.
<OL>
<li>On the Create Component screen, enter "gamepad" as the component <strong>Name</strong>  and select "input_controller" for the component <strong>Type</strong>. </li>

<li>There are no <strong>Model</strong> options for input_controllers.
Therefore, for <strong>Model</strong>, please manually enter, "gamepad," (without the quotes) then press Tab. The Viam app will retain your entry.</li>


<li>Click <strong>New Component</strong>. The Viam app opens the Component Config panel for the gamepad. </li>
<li>On the Component Config panel, leave <strong>Depends On</strong> set to empty.</li>

<li>The Viam app does not add any JSON attributes to the input_controller configuration.

Please add the following Attributes:
</OL>

```json-viam
{
 "base": "scuttle",
 "input_controller": "gamepad"
}
```

The controller config adds the gamepad controller to your robot.
However, it does not wire it up to any functionality.
This requires a Service.

## Adding a Service

To link the controller's input to the base functionality, we need to add our first `service`.
Services are the software packages that provide our robots with cool and powerful functionality.

1. Click **Create Service** under **services** at the top of the Viam app ([https://app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com)).
2. Enter "Base Remote Control" for Component `type`. "Base Remote Control" is a service we provide for driving a rover with a gamepad.
3. Enter **scuttle_gamepad** for the Service `name`.

<img src="../img/pi-game-create-service.png" />

After adding the Attributes, your config screen should appear similar to this:

<img src="../img/pi-game-service-config.png" />

Save the configuration and visit the control UI on The Viam app ([https://app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com)).

You should see the panel for the Controller Service and its connection indicator.
This is how your web UI will look.
Note the green Connection indicator:

At this point, you should be able to move the SCUTTLE. If you are in the specific mode that allows you to use the Joystick (#7), it will change the values in your robot config:

```
"X
0.0000
Y
0.0000"
```

If you are in the specific mode that allows you to use the D-Pad (#8), it will change the values:
```
"Hat0X
0.0000
Hat0Y
0.0000"
```

Testing these attributes will tell you which mode you are in.

## EasySMX ESM-9101 Wireless Controller Information

Here is a diagram of the gamepad.

To change the in-use movement/direction control on the gamepad between the D-Pad and the Joystick, press and hold the Home button (#11) until it displays the lighted segment combination for the gamepad configuration you need.
Each red color arrangement allows you to control the gamepad in the Viam app:
