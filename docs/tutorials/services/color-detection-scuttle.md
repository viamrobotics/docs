{{< alert title="Caution" color="caution" >}}
There are [breaking changes in the Vision Service](/appendix/release-notes/#25-april-2023).
This tutorial has not yet been updated.
{{< /alert >}}

This tutorial shows how to use the Viam [Vision Service](/services/vision/) to make a [SCUTTLE rover](https://www.scuttlerobot.org/) follow a colored object.

### Code used in this tutorial

[`scuttle.py` GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/mestcihazal/e78e3b29c58aa301c9a197ada272e6a0)

## Prerequisites

The prerequisite of this tutorial is to have a [SCUTTLE rover](https://www.scuttlerobot.org/) connected to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Please refer to the [Configure a SCUTTLE Robot tutorial](../../configure/scuttlebot/) if you have not already configured your SCUTTLE.

### Set up your code environment

We highly suggest using a virtual Python environment like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Then create an environment for Python by running the following on the terminal:

```sh {id="terminal-prompt" class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
poetry new pysdk  # new poetry project
conda create -n pysdk python=3.9  # new (mini)conda environment
```

You can also name your environment as you wish, but please remember to keep it consistent.
We named our environment pysdk, referring to the [Viam Python SDK](https://python.viam.dev/).

NOTE: If using (mini)conda, activate the environment by running the following command:

```sh {id="terminal-prompt" class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
conda activate pysdk
```

Poetry environments are implicitly activated.

Before you can run the code, you need to install the "viam" module.
Follow the [Python SDK installation](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-python-sdk#installation) guide to properly install the package.

NOTE: If using a python environment, ensure that the package is installed in the proper environment.

```sh {id="terminal-prompt" class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
pip freeze | grep viam  # generic
poetry show | grep viam  # for poetry environments
conda list | grep viam  # for (mini)conda environments
```

You should see `viam-sdk` listed near the end.

## Save the code

Download the [<file>scuttle.py</file>](https://gist.github.com/mestcihazal/e78e3b29c58aa301c9a197ada272e6a0) code to a directory on your computer.
Feel free to choose your own location, but as an example, weâ€™ve chosen the Desktop.

In the Python code, you must add your robot's address and secret (payload), which are found on the **Code sample** tab of the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).

Viam pre-populates the **Code sample** tab with the robot name, address, and secret:

![Remote configuration code sample](/tutorials/copy-remotes-code.png)

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

In your local copy of <file>scuttle.py</file>, paste your robot payload and address where indicated.
Save the file.

Now you are ready to run the code!

## Run the code

Now you should try to drive the SCUTTLE around following the color red.
You can use something like a red sports ball or book cover as a target to follow.

Navigate to the folder where you saved the Python script.
From that folder, run this in the terminal:

```sh {id="terminal-prompt" class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
python scuttle.py
```

Be sure to replace <file>~/Desktop/</file> with the <file>/path/toYour/directory/</file> where the Python code was saved.

```sh {id="terminal-prompt" class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
python ~/Desktop/scuttle.py
```

## Notes on color detection operation

Within `getVisService(robot)`, a detector is configured with particular properties and subsequently added to the Vision Service.
This particular detector is a [color detector](/services/vision/detection/), which means the relevant parameters are `detect_color` (hex string), `hue_tolerance_pct` (float from `0` to `1`), and `segment_size_px` (integer).
Feel free to configure more detectors with different parameters!
To learn about all the different detectors and parameters, check out the [Vision Service documentation](/services/vision/).

The `leftOrRight()` code splits the screen vertically into thirds (left, center, and right) and makes a determination about which third the object (red ball) is in.
Within `main()`, this decides how the robot moves (as configured by the 4 given variables).
Run the code as is before making changes to see how it affects the output!
