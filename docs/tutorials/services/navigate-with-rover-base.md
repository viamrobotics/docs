One key feature of Viam is [the navigation service](/services/navigation/), the stateful definition of Viam's [motion service](/services/motion/).

Using Navigation, you can queue up user-defined waypoints and your robot will move to them in the order that you specify.
You can also add obstacles or set linear and angular velocity targets in your navigation service config.
Viam's motion planner will plan routes that avoid those obstacles and attempt to keep the robot at your specified velocity.

To try it out yourself, you need a mobile base and a movement sensor that can track the robot's GPS coordinates and angular and linear velocity.
Follow this tutorial to get started using Viam's Navigation service to help your wheeled base navigate across space with our recommended stack.

## Requirements

1. **A wheeled base with encoded motors**

   We used [a LEO rover](https://www.leorover.tech/shop?gclid=CjwKCAjw38SoBhB6EiwA8EQVLiDwUFEYgLxaRd1-TiTyLfifIAHs9iD6YnvdW6M-3rXruHOrzfTL2RoCD1AQAvD_BwE), configured as a [`wheeled` base](/components/base/wheeled/), but you can use whatever model of rover base you have on hand:

   {{<imgproc src="/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/leo-in-office.png" resize="500x" declaredimensions=true alt="Leo rover that is navigating using the navigation service in a robotics lab.">}}

2. **A movement sensor with GPS position and angular and linear velocity readings**

   We used three movement sensors to satisfy these requirements:

   1. A [SparkFun GPS-RTK-SMA Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16481) [movement sensor](/components/movement-sensor/) configured as a [`gps-nmea-rtk-serial`](/components/movement-sensor/gps/gps-nmea-rtk-serial/) model, providing GPS position measurements.
   2. A [`wheeled-odometry`](/components/movement-sensor/wheeled-odometry/) model gathering angular and linear velocity information from the [encoders](/components/encoder/) wired to our base's [motors](/components/motor/).
   3. A [`merged`](/components/movement-sensor/merged/) model aggregating the readings together for the navigation service to consume.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}

If you are using different hardware, the navigation setup process will be mostly the same, but you will need to substitute your robot's components.

{{% /alert %}}

Before you start, make sure to create a robot in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com) and [install `viam-server`](/installation/) on your robot.

## Configure the components you need

First, configure the components of your robot.
If you are using different _models_ of hardware, adjust your configuration accordingly.

### Configure a board with `"digital_interrupts"`

First, configure the [board](/components/board/) local to your rover.
Follow [these instructions](/components/board/#configuration) to configure your board model.
We used a [`jetson` board](/components/board/jetson/), but you can use any model of board you have on hand, as the [resource's API](/components/board/#api) is hardware agnostic.

1. Configure a board named `local` as shown below:

![Configuration of a jetson board with digital interrupts in the Viam app config builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/board-config-builder.png)

2. Configure [digital interrupts](/components/board/#digital_interrupts) on your board to signal precise GPIO state changes to the [encoders](/components/encoder/) on your rover base.
   Copy and paste the following into your board's **Attributes** to add [digital interrupts](/components/board/#digital_interrupts) on pins `31`, `29`, `23`, and `21`:

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
  "digital_interrupts": [
    {
      "name": "ra",
      "pin": "31"
    },
    {
      "pin": "29",
      "name": "rb"
    },
    {
      "pin": "23",
      "name": "lb"
    },
    {
      "name": "la",
      "pin": "21"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Save your config.

### Configure a rover base with encoded motors

Configure your rover base to act as the moving platform of the navigating robot.
Start by configuring the [encoders](/components/encoder/) and [motors](/components/motor/) of your encoded motor.

1. Follow [these instructions](/components/) to configure the left and right encoders of the wheeled base.
   We configured ours as [`incremental` encoders](/components/encoder/incremental/), as shown below:

   {{<imgproc src="/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/right-encoder-config-builder.png" resize="400x" declaredimensions=true alt="Configuration of a right incremental encoder in the Viam app config builder." class="aligncenter" style="min-height:550px; max-height:600px">}}

   {{<imgproc src="/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/left-encoder-config-builder.png" resize="400x" declaredimensions=true alt="Configuration of a left incremental encoder in the Viam app config builder." class="aligncenter" style="min-height:550px; max-height:600px">}}

   Assign the pins as the [digital interrupts](/components/board/#digital_interrupts) you configured for the board, and wire the encoders accordingly to pins {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="pin-number" text="numbered" >}} `31`, `29`, `23`, and `21` on your `local` board.
   Refer to the [`incremental` encoder documentation](/components/encoder/incremental/) for attribute information.

2. Next, follow [these instructions](/components/motor/#configuration) to configure the left and right [motors](/components/motor/) of the `wheeled` base.
   We [configured ours as `gpio` motors](/components/motor/gpio/), as shown below:

   ![Configuration of a right gpio motor in the Viam app config builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/right-motor-config-builder.png)

   ![Configuration of a left gpio motor in the Viam app config builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/left-motor-config-builder.png)
   Wire the motors accordingly to the GPIO pins {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="pin-number" text="numbered" >}} `35`, `35`, `15`, `38`, `40`, and `33` on your `local` board.
   Refer to the [`gpio` motor](/components/motor/gpio/) documentation for attribute information.

3. Finally, configure whatever rover you have as a [`wheeled`](/components/base/wheeled/) model of base, bringing the motion produced by these motors together on one platform:
   ![An example configuration for a wheeled base in the Viam app Config Builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/wheeled-base-config-builder.png)

   - Make sure to select each of your right and left motors as **Right Motors** and **Left Motors** and set the wheel circumference and width of each of the wheels the motors are attached to.
   - [Configure the frame system](/services/frame-system/#configuration) for this wheeled base so that the navigation service knows where it is in relation to the movement sensor.
     - Click on **Add frame** on the **Config** tab, and, if your movement sensor is mounted on top of the rover like ours is, set **Orientation**'s **Z** to `1` and **Th** to 90.
     - Select the `world` as the parent frame.

   Refer to the [`wheeled` base configuration instructions](/components/base/wheeled/) for attribute information.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}

Be sure to wire the board to the encoders and motors on your base matching this configuration.
If you choose to wire your components differently, adjust your pin assignment configuration from these instructions according to your wiring.

{{< /alert >}}

### Configure movement sensors

1.  Configure a GPS movement sensor so the robot knows where it is while navigating.
    We configured ours as a `gps-nmea-rtk-serial` movement sensor:

    ![An example configuration for a GPS movement sensor in the Viam app Config Builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/gps-movement-sensor-config-builder.png)

    We named ours `gps`.
    Refer to [the `gps-nmea-rtk-serial` movement sensor documentation](/components/movement-sensor/gps/gps-nmea-rtk-serial/) for attribute information.

    ![An example configuration for a wheeled-odometry movement sensor in the Viam app Config Builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/wheeled-odometry-movement-sensor-config-builder.png)

    We named ours `enc-linear`.
    Refer to [the `wheeled-odometry` movement sensor documentation](/components/movement-sensor/wheeled-odometry/) for attribute information.

2.  Now that you've got movement sensors which can give you GPS position and linear and angular velocity readings, configure a `merged` movement sensor to aggregate the readings from our other movement sensors into a singular sensor:

    ![An example configuration for a merged movement sensor in the Viam app Config Builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/merged-movement-sensor-config-builder.png)

    We named ours `merged`.
    Refer to [the `merged` movement sensor documentation](/components/movement-sensor/merged/) for attribute information.

    - Make sure your `merged` movement sensor is configured to gather `"position"` readings from the `gps` movement sensor.
    - [Configure the frame system](/services/frame-system/#configuration) for this movement sensor so that the navigation service knows where it is in relation to the base.
      Click on **Add frame** on the **Config** tab, and, if your movement sensor is mounted on top of the rover like ours is, set **Orientation**'s **Z** to `1`.
      Select the `base` as the parent frame.

### Full JSON Configuration

## Configure a Navigation service

Add the navigation service so that your wheeled base can navigate between waypoints and avoid obstacles.
To add the navigation service to your robot, do the following:

1. On your robot's **Config** page, navigate to the **Services** tab.
2. At the bottom of the page, create a service.
   Choose `Navigation` as the type.
3. Then click **Create Service**.
4. Select **Raw JSON** mode. Copy and paste the following into your new service's `"attributes"`:

   ```json
   {
     "base": "base",
     "movement_sensor": "merged",
     "obstacles": [],
     "store": {
       "type": "memory"
     },
     "position_polling_frequency": 2,
     "meters_per_sec": 1.2,
     "degs_per_sec": 90,
     "plan_deviation_m": 0.25
   }
   ```

   Edit the attributes as applicable.
   Attribute information is available in [the navigation service documentation](/services/navigation/#configuration).

5. Click **Save Config** at the bottom of the window.

Your navigation service should now appear in your robot's **Config** tab as a card with a map like the following:

![Navigation Card](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/navigation-config-builder.png)

For more detailed information see [the navigation service](/services/navigation/#configuration).

### Full JSON Configuration

At this point, if you switch to **Raw JSON** mode in your robot's **Config** tab, the full `"services"` array should look similar to the following:

{{%expand "Click to view full example JSON" %}}

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
"services": [
  {
    "name": "nav",
    "type": "navigation",
    "attributes": {
    "base": "base",
    "movement_sensor": "merged",
    "obstacles": [],
    "store": {
        "type": "memory"
    },
    "position_polling_frequency": 2,
    "meters_per_sec": 1.2,
    "degs_per_sec": 90,
    "plan_deviation_m": 0.25
    }
  }
]
```

{{% /expand%}}

## Start navigating with the Navigation service

Now that you have configured your navigation service, add waypoints to your navigation service.
You can add waypoints from the [Control tab](#control-tab-method) or [programmatically](#programmatic-method).

### Control tab method

Go to the **Control** tab of your robot in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com), and open the **navigation** card.
From there, ensure that **Navigation mode** is selected as **Manual**, so your robot will not begin navigation while you add waypoints.

#### Add waypoints

Select **Waypoints** on the upper-left corner menu of the navigation card.
Zoom in on your current location and click on the map to add a waypoint.

![Waypoint 0 being added in the Viam app config builder on a New York City street](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/add-first-waypoint.png)

Add as many waypoints as you desire.
Hover over a waypoint in the left-hand menu and click the trash icon to delete a waypoint.

![Waypoint 1 being added in the Viam app config builder, further down the street](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/add-second-waypoint.png)

#### (Optional) Add obstacles

If you want your robot to avoid certain obstacles in its path while navigating, you can also add obstacles.
Select **Obstacles** on the upper-left corner menu of the navigation card.
Zoom in on your current location and click on the map to add an obstacle.
Add as many obstacles as you desire.
Hover over an obstacle in the left-hand menu and click the trash icon to delete an obstacle.

#### Begin navigation

Toggle **Navigation mode** to **Waypoint**.
Your rover will begin navigating between waypoints.

### Programmatic method

If you want to do add waypoints programmatically, use the service's [API method `AddWaypoint()`](/services/navigation/#addwaypoint):

#### Add waypoints

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```go
myNav, err := navigation.FromRobot(robot, "my_nav_service")

// Create a new waypoint at the specified latitude and longitude
location = geo.NewPoint(40.76275, -73.96)

// Add your waypoint to the service's data storage
err := myNav.AddWaypoint(context.Background(), location, nil)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```python
my_nav = NavigationClient.from_robot(robot=robot, name="my_nav_service")

# Create a new waypoint at the specified latitude and longitude
location = GeoPoint(latitude=40.76275, longitude=-73.96)

# Add your waypoint to the service's data storage
await my_nav.add_waypoint(point=location)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

#### Begin navigation

To start navigating, set your service to `MODE_WAYPOINT` with the service's [API method `SetMode()`](/services/navigation/#setmode):

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}

```go
myNav, err := navigation.FromRobot(robot, "my_nav_service")

// Set the Mode the service is operating in to MODE_WAYPOINT and begin navigation
mode, err := myNav.SetMode(context.Background(), Mode.MODE_WAYPOINT, nil)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}

```python
my_nav = NavigationClient.from_robot(robot=robot, name="my_nav_service")

# Set the Mode the service is operating in to MODE_WAYPOINT and begin
# navigation
await my_nav.set_mode(Mode.ValueType.MODE_WAYPOINT)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Next steps: automate obstacle detection

In this tutorial, you have learned how to use Navigation to navigate across waypoints.
Now, you can make navigation even better with automated obstacle detection.

First, configure a depth [camera](/components/camera/) that your robot can sense how far away it is from obstacles.

We configured ours as an [Intel RealSense Camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/), which is available as a [modular resource](/extend/modular-resources/) [in the Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/realsense):

![An example configuration for an Intel RealSense camera in the Viam app Config Builder.](/tutorials/navigate-with-rover-base/realsense-camera-config-builder.png)

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}

You can alternatively use an [`ultrasonic` sensor](/components/sensor/ultrasonic/) configured as a camera.
Attribute information for an `ultrasonic` [camera](/components/camera/) is the same as [for a sensor](/components/sensor/ultrasonic/).

{{< /alert >}}

If you want the robot to be able to automatically detect obstacles in front of it, [configure a Vision service segmenter](/services/vision/segmentation/).
For example, [configure](/services/vision/segmentation/#configure-an-obstacles_depth-segmenter) the Vision service model [`obstacles_depth`](/services/vision/segmentation/#configure-an-obstacles_depth-segmenter) to detect obstacles in front of the robot.
Then, use one of [Viam's client SDKs](/program/) to automate obstacle avoidance with the navigation service like in the following Python program:

{{%expand "Click to view full example of automated obstacle avoidance with the Python SDK" %}}
