Viam is a software platform that makes it easy to combine and integrate hardware and software to build machines, connect them with the cloud, and make them smarter with machine learning.

<img src="../about-viam.png" width="800px" alt="Viam architecture on device where viam-server uses the machine configuration to manage drivers for different hardware and in the cloud where the platform offer data management, ML, and extended functionality.">

## Support

Viam runs on microcontrollers and 64-bit Linux OS, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Viam on your machine

At the core of Viam is the open-source `viam-server` executable which runs on a computer and provides drivers for hardware and manages software and data for a machine.
If you are working with microcontrollers, [`viam-micro-server`](/installation/) is a lightweight version of `viam-server` which can run on resource-limited embedded systems.

- **Modularity**: `viam-server` runs hardware drivers and software to operate your machine.
  A machine consists of {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}} and higher-level software {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="services" >}}.
- **Standard APIs**: Each {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resource" >}} type has a standard, hardware-agnostic API.

- **Remote control**: You can use the Viam app, the Viam mobile app, or your own custom apps, to control and monitor your machines securely **from anywhere in the world**.
- **Local control**: In factory settings or remote environments, you can operate and monitor your machines over a local area network (LAN).

## Viam Cloud

The [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) is the ecosystem for configuring and managing machines which provides:

- **Configuration**: As you configure your machine, you can test each resource to confirm it is working as expected in the same UI you use for configuration.
- **Extensibility**: To support more hardware and software, you can use _{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="modules" >}}_ from the [Viam Registry](/registry/) or create your own for custom needs.
- **Intelligence**: Make your machines smarter and better with [data management](/services/data/), [machine learning](/services/ml/), [SLAM](/services/slam/) and more.

- Capture sensor data on 100s of boats and sync it to the cloud when machines have internet connectivity.

- Use machine learning to detect wildlife and when detected start data capture and send alerts.

- Allow delivery robots to use their location and SLAM to navigate intelligently between GPS coordinates.

### Fleet management

The [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) enables the following **fleet management** capabilities:

- **Deployment**: Configure and update hardware, software, and machine learning models for groups of machines in one go.
- **Management** Manage deployments and permissions using RBAC.
- **Observability & Teleoperation**: Control and debug machines from anywhere.

## Next steps

In the next few pages we will guide you through the platform.
You don't need to buy or own any hardware to follow along.
