## Power your Orange Pi Zero2

Before you power the board, you need to install an operating system.

1. First, download an [Orange Pi Ubuntu image](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ohxfoxWJ0sv8yEHbrXL1Bu2RkBhuCMup) to your development machine.
   We recommend `ubuntu_jammy_desktop`.
1. Insert the micro-SD card into the SD card reader and connect the reader to your development machine.
1. Follow [this guide](https://sbc-community.org/docs/general_guides/prepare_sd_card/) to flash the OS to your microSD card using [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
1. Insert the micro-SD into the Orange Pi.

To power your Orange Pi Zero2, connect your power adapter to the Zero2's USB-C port.
The LED should light up, which indicates that the board is powered.

If your board's LED does not light up when powered, try re-flashing your micro-SD card with the `ubuntu_jammy_desktop` image or using a different micro-SD card.
The OrangePi will only power on with a compatible operating system installed.

To connect to a display, connect the micro-HDMI end of your HDMI cable to the Orange Pi and the other end to your monitor.
Then, to connect the keyboard and mouse, plug the two devices into your USB hub and connect the USB hub to your Orange Pi's USB-A port.

You should now be greeted with the Orange Pi display.
If it prompts you for a password, note that the default password for Orange Pi devices is "orangepi".

## Establish a network connection

The Orange Pi Zero2 comes equipped with a wireless network antenna.
To connect to WiFi, click on the WiFi icon in the top right of the monitor display, select your preferred network or hotspot, and enter the password.
