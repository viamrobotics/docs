- A microSD card
- A desktop or laptop computer for flashing the microSD card
- A way to connect the microSD card to the computer (a microSD slot or microSD reader)
- An Ethernet cable
- An HDMI cable

## Required downloads

Download the following files to your computer:

- Download the <a href="https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-SK-TDA4VM" target="_blank">PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-SK-TDA4VM — Linux SDK for edge AI applications on TDA4VM Jacinto™ processors</a> image.

## Install Viam dependencies on the TDA4VM

1. Connect the board to Ethernet.

2. Connect the board to a monitor with the HDMI cable.

3. Connect the board to power using the USB-C power cable.

4. Use the credentials and IP address displayed in the upper right-hand corner of the monitor to SSH into the board.

From the SSH session on the TDA4VM board:

1. Clone the TDA4VM repo:

   ```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
   git clone https://github.com/viam-labs/tda4vm-setup.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the setup directory:

   ```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
   cd tda4vm-setup/
   ```

3. Make the server setup script executable:

   ```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
   chmod +x tda4vm-viam-setup.sh
   ```

4. Launch the setup script to install `viam-server` dependencies:

   ```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
   ./tda4vm-viam-setup.sh
   ```

   Once this process completes, the board will reboot.
