Once you've [installed `viam-server`](/get-started/installation/), you can chose to run it as a system service or directly on the command line.
Running as a system service enables you to configure `viam-server` to start automatically when your system boots, and is the [default installation option](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server) on Linux.
Running on the command line is suitable for local development.

## Run `viam-server`

Select the tab for your platform:

{{< tabs name="Managing viam-server">}}
{{% tab name="Linux"%}}

### Run as a system service

After [installation](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server), the `viam-server` [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) binary will be located at <file>/usr/local/bin/viam-server</file>, and a `systemd` service file will be placed at <file>/etc/systemd/system/viam-server.service</file>.
By default, `viam-server` is configured to start when the machine boots.

Running `viam-server` as a system service is the recommended method for Linux.

You can use the following commands to manage `viam-server` when installed as a system service.
These commands require that you store your configuration file at <file>/etc/viam.json</file>.

#### Start

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl start viam-server
```

#### Stop

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl stop viam-server
```

#### Restart

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl restart viam-server
```

#### Enable (start automatically with system boot, default)

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl enable viam-server
```

#### Disable (do not start automatically with system boot)

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl disable viam-server
```

### Run from the command line

When running `viam-server` on the command line, you can use the following commands to manage the process.
If `viam-server` is already running as a system service, be sure to stop the service first before using these commands.

#### Start

Run the following on the command line to start `viam-server`, providing the path to your own configuration file:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo viam-server -config /path/to/my/config.json
```

If you followed the [Installation Guide](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server), your machine's configuration file is available at <file>/etc/viam.json</file>.
You can provide this path in the above command, or move the configuration file to a desired location and change the path in this command accordingly.
If you don't yet have a configuration file, you can [build a new configuration file](/internals/local-configuration-file/).

Note that on a Raspberry Pi, `viam-server` must always run as `root` (using `sudo`) in order to access the DMA subsystem for GPIO.
When running `viam-server` from your home directory on a Linux computer, you do not need to use `sudo`.

#### Stop

Press **Ctrl + C** on your keyboard within the terminal session where you are running `viam-server` to stop it.

### Run from the command line

After [installation](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server), `viam-server` can be run directly on the command line.

Running `viam-server` on the command line is the recommended method for macOS.

You can use the following commands to manage `viam-server` on the command line:

#### Start

Run the following on the command line to start `viam-server`, providing the path to your own configuration file:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
viam-server -config /path/to/my/config.json
```

If you followed the [Installation Guide](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server), your machine's configuration file is available in your <file>~/Downloads/</file> directory, named similarly to <file>viam-machinename-main.json</file>.
You can provide this path in the above command, or move the configuration file to a desired location and change the path in this command accordingly.
If you don't yet have a configuration file, you can use the example configuration file provided at <file>/opt/homebrew/etc/viam.json</file> or you can [build a new configuration file](/internals/local-configuration-file/).

#### Stop

Type **Ctrl + C** on your keyboard within the terminal session where you are running `viam-server` to stop it.

### Run as a system service

Installing `viam-server` as a system service is not recommended for most use cases on macOS.
However, if you are looking to create a machine that runs on macOS and you want it to run `viam-server` automatically when your macOS system boots, then you will need to run `viam-server` as a service.

Once you have [installed `viam-server`](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server) on your macOS computer, use the following commands to control the service.
These commands require that you store your configuration file at <file>/opt/homebrew/etc/viam.json</file>.

#### Start

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew services start viam-server
```

#### Stop

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew services stop viam-server
```

#### Restart

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew services restart viam-server
```

## Update `viam-server`

To update to the newest RDK version, you need to update your `viam-server`.
Select the tab for your platform:

{{< tabs name="Updating viam-server" >}}
{{% tab name=Linux %}}

`viam-server` is distributed for Linux as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/), and includes a built-in self-update feature.
When you [run `viam-server`](#run-viam-server) as a service on Linux, it will check for updates automatically on launch, and update itself if a newer version is detected.

The automatic update behavior of `viam-server` should meet the needs of most deployments, but if you need to manually force an update, you can do so with the `--aix-update` flag:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo viam-server --aix-update
```

### Disable service-based updates

If you want to disable `viam-server` from automatically checking for updates each time you launch it, comment out the `ExecStartPre` line from your <file>/etc/systemd/system/viam-server.service</file> service file (by prepending with a `#` character), so that it matches the following:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
# ExecStartPre=-/usr/local/bin/viam-server --aix-update
```

Then, reload the service file with the following command:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

To resume automatic update checking, delete the leading `#` character once more, and run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` again.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name=macOS %}}

`viam-server` is distributed for macOS through the Homebrew package manager, which includes a built-in update feature.

To upgrade to the latest version of `viam-server` using Homebrew:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew upgrade viam-server
```

Homebrew does not support automatic updates, so you will need to manually perform this step each time you wish to check for updates. We recommend running `brew upgrade viam-server` on a regular basis.
