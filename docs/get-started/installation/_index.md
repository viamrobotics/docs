`viam-server` is the binary built from [Robot Development Kit](https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk) that contains and manages communications between all Viam's built-in hardware drivers ({{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}}) and software {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="services" >}}, connects your machine to the cloud, manages machine configuration, and manages dependencies including {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="module" text="modules" >}}.

To use Viam software with your machine, install and run `viam-server` on the single board computer (SBC) or other computer that will run your machine and is connected to your hardware.
Installing on a laptop or desktop computer is useful if you don't have an SBC available, or if you want to run a Viam [service](/services/) with your machine that requires more computing resources than are otherwise available on an SBC.

For an overview of the Viam software platform, see [Viam in 3 minutes](/get-started/viam/).

## Compatibility

`viam-server` supports:

- Linux 64-bit operating systems running on the `aarch64` or `x86_64` architectures
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- macOS

## Prepare your board

If you are using one of the following boards, click on the card to follow the guide for that board:

{{% card link="/get-started/installation/prepare/beaglebone-setup/" class="small" %}}
{{% card link="/get-started/installation/prepare/sk-tda4vm/" class="small" %}}

Viam also provides a lightweight version of `viam-server` which can run on resource-limited embedded systems that cannot run the fully-featured Robot Development Kit (RDK).
If you are using a microcontroller, prepare your board using the following guide:

Other SBCs such as the [RockPi S](https://wiki.radxa.com/RockpiS) and [Orange Pi Zero 2](https://orangepi.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=237&product_id=849) can run Viam with an experimental [periph.io](https://periph.io/) based [modular component](https://github.com/viam-labs/periph_board).
