- [**Component-Based Approach →**]()

  Divide complex projects into small, loosely coupled components that can be created and tested independently.

- [**Standardized Interfaces →**]()

  Common hardware components such as robotic arms or cameras use the same APIs.

- [**Viam Registry →**]()

  Mix and match publicly available components from the Viam Registry with your own components.

- [**Infrastructure as code →**]()

  Define the set of components that work together in a machine in JSON format.

- [**Incremental Development →**]()

  Make versioned changes to the JSON configuration for a machine's hardware and software.

- [**Platform Capabilities →**]()

  Make use of builtin data management, machine learning, motion planning, and more.

- [**Fleet Management →**](/manage/)

  Remotely deploy and manage software on any fleet of devices.
