Depending on how old of a software image you already have running on your BeagleBone, you might need to update your BeagleBone to the latest software image.
If you experience any issues getting Viam working on your BeagleBone, you should consult the BeagleBone getting started documentation at <a href="https://beagleboard.org/getting-started" target="_blank">beagleboard.org/getting-started</a> for steps on updating your BeagleBone.

### Power your BeagleBone

You need a data connection from the BeagleBone to your computer.
A USB-C to USB-C from your computer to your BeagleBone is the most convenient method to make the data connection.
Although it is possible to power the BeagleBone via its USB-C connection, we recommend that you use a separate 5VDC power source (e.g., 5VDC charger) via the BeagleBoard's barrel jack as that is more reliable.
When powered on, you'll see the power (PWR or ON) LED lit steadily.
Within a minute or so, you should see the other LEDs blinking.

### Enable a network connection

You will need to connect an ethernet cable to your BeagleBone in order to connect to it.
If your computer supports mDNS (Multicast DNS), you should see your Beagle at <a href="https://beaglebone.local" target="_blank">beaglebone.local</a>.
Using any web browser (except Internet Explorer) you can test to see if your BeagleBone has successfully connected to the internet.

You can also connect to the internet via _internet connection sharing_.

If you are connecting to your BeagleBone with macOS, you can use <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-internet-connection-mac-network-users-mchlp1540/mac" target="_blank">Internet Sharing over USB</a> to connect to the internet.
After enabling it on your machine, SSH into your BeagleBone, and run the following: `sudo dhclient usb1`.

For Linux, you can follow this <a href="https://fastbitlab.com/how-to-enable-internet-over-usb/" target="_blank">tutorial for enabling internet over USB</a>.

The table below summarizes the typical addresses depending on how you are connecting to your BeagleBoard.

|     IP Address      | Connection Type  | Operating System(s)  |
|:------------------: |:---------------: |:-------------------: |
| 192.168.7.2         | USB              | Windows              |
| 192.168.6.2         | USB              | Mac OS X, Linux      |
| 192.168.8.1         | WiFi             | all                  |
| beaglebone.local    | all              | mDNS enabled         |
| beaglebone-2.local  | all              | mDNS enabled         |

```bash
ssh debian@beaglebone.local
```

### Check that your BeagleBone is connected to the internet

After you SSH into your BeagleBone, you can check that your BeagleBone is connected to the internet by running the following command:

```bash
ping -c 3 google.com
```

If you see a response like the one below, you are connected to the internet.

```bash
PING google.com (209.85.234.138): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 209.85.234.138: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=31.852 ms
64 bytes from 209.85.234.138: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=35.585 ms
64 bytes from 209.85.234.138: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=43.308 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 31.852/36.915/43.308/4.771 ms
```

### Update your BeagleBone

Next, best practice suggests that you always ensure that the latest packages are installed.
Run the following command to do verify the packages are up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade && sudo reboot
```

## Next steps

Now that your BeagleBone has a Viam-compatible operating system installed, continue to our [viam-server installation guide](/installation/install/).
