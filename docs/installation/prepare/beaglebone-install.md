The [BeagleBone AI-64](https://docs.beagleboard.org/latest/boards/beaglebone/ai-64/) from [BeagleBoard.org](https://beagleboard.org/) is an open-source single-board computer with a Debian GNU/Linux operating system based on the Texas Instruments TDA4VM processor.
Follow this guide to set up your BeagleBone AI-64 and prepare it for `viam-server` installation.

## Hardware Requirements

You need the following hardware, tools, and software to install `viam-server` on a BeagleBone AI-64:

1. A [BeagleBone AI-64](https://beagleboard.org/ai-64)
2. A 5V barrel jack (recommended) and/or USB-C power supply, to power the BeagleBone
3. Ethernet cable and/or WiFi dongle, to establish network connection on the BeagleBone
4. (Optional) A microSD card and a way to connect the microSD card to the computer (like a microSD slot or microSD reader)
    - This is required if you need to set up your BeagleBone for the first time or update your BeagleBone to the latest software image.

If you have already powered up and connected to your BeagleBone before coming to this guide, skip ahead to the [installation guide](/installation/install/).

However, you might need to update your BeagleBone to the latest software so your OS can run `viam-server`.

If you experience any issues getting Viam working on your BeagleBone, consult the [BeagleBone documentation](https://docs.beagleboard.org/latest/boards/beaglebone/ai-64/ch03.html) for help updating your BeagleBone, or reach out on the [the Viam Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/viamrobotics/shared_invite/zt-1f5xf1qk5-TECJc1MIY1MW0d6ZCg~Wnw).

The following instructions mirror the instructions given in the BeagleBoard documentation at [Connecting up your BeagleBone](https://docs.beagleboard.org/latest/boards/beaglebone/ai-64/ch03.html) and [Getting Started with your BeagleBone](https://beagleboard.org/getting-started).
If you want additional help setting up your BeagleBone, you can follow the guides there and return to the Viam docs after SSH'ing into your BeagleBone.



### Step 1: Power your BeagleBone

Power your board by plugging a 5VDC power source into the BeagleBone's barrel jack.
You can also power the BeagleBone with a USB-C cable, but a 5VDC power source is recommended for more reliable performance.

If the board has power, the LED on the board labeled *PWR* or *ON* is lit steadily.

### Step 2: Enable a network connection

You need to enable a network connection on your BeagleBone to install `viam-server` on it.
You can do this in multiple ways:
- Connect an ethernet cable to your BeagleBone's ethernet port.
- If you are on macOS, use [internet sharing over USB](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-internet-connection-mac-network-users-mchlp1540/mac) to connect to the internet.
   After enabling the option on your machine, SSH into your BeagleBone and run `sudo dhclient usb1`.
- If you are one Linux machine, follow the tutorial at [fastbitlab.com/how-to-enable-internet-over-usb/](https://fastbitlab.com/how-to-enable-internet-over-usb/) to enable internet sharing over USB.

You can also connect to the internet via internet connection sharing.

If your personal computer is macOS, you can use [internet sharing over USB](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-internet-connection-mac-network-users-mchlp1540/mac) to connect to the internet.
After enabling the option on your machine, SSH into your BeagleBone and run the following command: `sudo dhclient usb1`.

If your PC is Linux, you can follow the tutorial at [fastbitlab.com/how-to-enable-internet-over-usb/](https://fastbitlab.com/how-to-enable-internet-over-usb/) to enable internet sharing over USB.

- If your personal computer supports mDNS (Multicast DNS), you can check to see if your BeagleBone board has established a network connection by visiting [beaglebone.local](https://beaglebone.local).

### Step 3: SSH into your BeagleBone from your PC

You can SSH into your BeagleBone by running the following command in your terminal:

`ssh <your-username>@<your-hostname>.local`

By default, the hostname, username and password on a BeagleBone are:

- Hostname: `beaglebone`
- Username: `debian`
- Password: `temppwd`
  
Therefore, if you are using the default settings on your BeagleBone, the command is:

`ssh debian@beaglebone.local`

### Step 4: Update your BeagleBone

After SSH'ing into your BeagleBone, verify all packages are up to date:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade && sudo reboot`

### Step 5: Install `viam-server`

Now that your BeagleBone has a Viam-compatible operating system installed, continue to our [viam-server installation guide](/installation/install/) to install `viam-server` on the board.

## Troubleshooting

You can find additional assistance in the [Troubleshooting section](/appendix/troubleshooting/).

You can also ask questions on the [Viam Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/viamrobotics/shared_invite/zt-1f5xf1qk5-TECJc1MIY1MW0d6ZCg~Wnw) and we will be happy to help.
