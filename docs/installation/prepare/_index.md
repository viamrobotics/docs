Make sure your system is compatible with Viam.
Viam is supported on:

- Linux 64-bit operating systems
- macOS

If you are using a single board computer (SBC) like a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone, prepare your SBC by following the relevant setup document:

- [Raspberry Pi Setup Guide](/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/)
- [BeagleBone AI-64 Setup Guide](/installation/prepare/beaglebone-install/)

If you plan to run viam-server on your laptop or desktop with a Linux or Mac operating system, no special prep is required.
Proceed to [install viam-server](/installation/install/).
