Make sure your system is compatible with Viam.
Viam is supported on:

- Linux 64-bit operating systems
- macOS

If you are using a single board computer (SBC) like a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone, prepare your SBC by following the relevant setup document:

- [Raspberry Pi Setup Guide](/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/)
- [BeagleBone AI-64 Setup Guide](/installation/prepare/beaglebone-install/)
- [Texas Instruments SK-TDA4VM Setup Guide](/installation/prepare/sk-tda4vm/)
- [Jetson Nano Setup Guide](/installation/prepare/jetson-nano-setup/)

If you plan to run `viam-server` on your laptop or desktop with a Linux or Mac operating system, no special prep is required.
Proceed to [install `viam-server`](/installation/install/).
