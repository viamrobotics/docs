The [Jetson Nano™](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano) from [NVIDIA®](https://www.nvidia.com/) is a small, powerful computer that, despite its small size, is built for embedded applications and AI IoT, and is capable of supporting modern AI workloads.
Set up your NVIDIA Jetson Nano with the [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit).

## Hardware Requirements

You will need the following hardware, tools, and software to install `viam-server` on a Jetson Nano:

1. A [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
2. A microSD card (32GB UHS-1 minimum recommended)
3. A way to connect the microSD card to the computer (e.g., microSD slot or microSD reader)
4. USB keyboard and mouse
5. An internet-connected computer with computer display (HDMI or DP)
6. 5V-2A Micro-USB power supply

## Jetson Nano Setup Guide

1. Follow the instructions from [NVIDIA®](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) to get started with your Jetson Nano Developer Kit.
2. Once you have completed the *Introduction*, *Prepare for Setup*, *Write Image to the microSD Card*, and *Setup and First Boot* sections of NVIDIA's instructions, return to the Viam docs.
