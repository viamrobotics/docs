## Hardware Requirements

You need the following hardware, tools, and software to install `viam-server` on a Jetson Nano:

**Initial Setup with Display Attached:**

1. A [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
2. A microSD card (32GB UHS-1 minimum recommended)
3. A computer display (HDMI or DP) with USB keyboard and mouse
4. A way to connect the microSD card to the computer (like a microSD slot or microSD reader)
5. Ethernet cable and/or Wifi dongle, to establish network connection on the Nano
6. 5V-2A DC with barrel jack connector and/or Micro-USB power supply, to power the Nano

**Initial Setup in Headless Mode:**

1. A [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
2. A microSD card (32GB UHS-1 minimum recommended)
3. An internet-connected computer
4. A way to connect the computer to the Nano (like a USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro B Cable)
5. A way to connect the microSD card to the computer (like a microSD slot or microSD reader)
6. Ethernet cable and/or Wifi dongle, to establish network connection on the Nano
7. 5V-2A DC with barrel jack connector power supply, to power the Nano (Micro-USB port will be taken by the cable connection to computer)

## Jetson Nano Setup Guide

1. Follow the instructions in [Getting Started with Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit).
   Once you have reached *Next Steps*, return to the Viam docs.
2. Your Jetson Nano now has a Viam-compatible operating system installed.
   Continue to [install viam-server](/installation/#install-viam-server).
   Note that the Jetson Nano has aarch64 CPU architecture.

{{< alert title="Tip: <code>viam-server</code> installation with <code>curl</code>" color="tip" >}}

If `curl` is not installed on your Orin, run `sudo apt install curl` before downloading the `viam-server` binary.

If this command fails, try using `wget https://storage.googleapis.com/packages.viam.com/apps/viam-server/viam-server-stable-aarch64.AppImage` to download the `viam-server` binary.
