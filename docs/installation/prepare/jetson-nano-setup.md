The [Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano) and [Jetson Orin Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin) from [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) are small computers built for embedded applications and capable of supporting modern AI workloads.
Follow this guide to set up the [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) or the [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-orin-developer-kit) to prepare your NVIDIA Jetson Nano for `viam-server` installation.

This guide assumes that you have a Jetson Nano Developer Kit or a Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit with a Jetson module and reference carrier board.
If you want to use a different carrier board to incorporate your Nano into your robot, the type of carrier board you use will affect your hardware requirements.

## Hardware Requirements

You need the following hardware, tools, and software to install `viam-server` on a Jetson Nano or Jetson Orin Nano:

**Initial Setup with Display Attached:**

1. A [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) or [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-orin-developer-kit)
2. A microSD card (32GB UHS-1 minimum recommended)
3. A computer display (HDMI or DP) with a USB keyboard and mouse
4. A way to connect the microSD card to the computer (like a microSD slot or microSD reader)
5. Ethernet cable and/or Wifi dongle, to establish network connection on the Nano
6. 5V-2A (Nano) or 9-19V (Orin Nano) DC power supply with barrel jack connector

**Initial Setup in Headless Mode:**

1. A [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) or [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-orin-developer-kit)
2. A microSD card (32GB UHS-1 minimum recommended)
3. An internet-connected computer
4. A way to connect the computer to the Nano (like a USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro B Cable)
5. A way to connect the microSD card to the computer (like a microSD slot or microSD reader)
6. Ethernet cable and/or Wifi dongle, to establish network connection on the Nano
7. 5V-2A (Nano) or 9-19V (Orin Nano) DC power supply with barrel jack connector

## Nano Setup Guide

1. Follow the instructions in [Getting Started with Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) or [Getting Started with Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit).
   Once you have reached _Next Steps_, return to the Viam docs.
2. Your Jetson Nano or Jetson Orin Nano now has a Viam-compatible operating system installed.
   Continue to [install viam-server](/installation/#install-viam-server).
   Note that the Jetson Nano and Jetson Orin Nano have `aarch64` CPU architecture.

{{< alert title="Tip: <code>viam-server</code> installation with <code>curl</code>" color="tip" >}}

If `curl` is not installed on your Orin, run `sudo apt install curl` before downloading the `viam-server` binary.

If this command fails, try using `wget https://storage.googleapis.com/packages.viam.com/apps/viam-server/viam-server-stable-aarch64.AppImage` to download the `viam-server` binary.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure the polarity on your barrel jack power supply is matched when powering your robot.
See the last step of your appropriate [initial setup guide](#hardware-requirements) for instructions on choosing the correct power supply for your Nano board.

You can find additional assistance in the [Troubleshooting section](/appendix/troubleshooting/).
