## Power your Orange Pi 3 LTS

Before you power the board, you need to install an operating system.

1. First, download an [Orange Pi 3 LTS Ubuntu image](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KzyzyByev-fpZat7yvgYz1omOqFFqt1k) to your development machine.
   We recommend `ubuntu_jammy_desktop`.
1. Unzip the image.
1. Insert the micro-SD card into the SD card reader and connect the reader to your development machine.
1. Follow the [Orange Pi guide to prepare your microSD card](https://sbc-community.org/docs/general_guides/prepare_sd_card/) to flash the OS to your micro-SD card using [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
1. Insert the micro-SD into the Orange Pi.

To power your Orange Pi 3 LTS, connect your power adapter to the LTS's USB-C port.
The LED should light up, which indicates that the board is powered.

If your board's LED does not light up when powered, try re-flashing your micro-SD card with the `ubuntu_jammy_desktop` image or using a different micro-SD card.
The Orange Pi will only power on with a compatible operating system installed.

To connect to a display, connect the HDMI cable to the Orange Pi's HDMI port and the other end to your monitor.
Then, connect your keyboard and mouse to the two USB-A ports on your Orange Pi.
Alternatively, you can connect your peripherals to a USB hub and connect the USB hub to your Orange Pi's USB-A port.

Once the Orange Pi successfully boots, you should be greeted with the Orange Pi desktop display.
If you are prompted for a login password, note that the default password for Orange Pi devices is "orangepi".

## Establish a network connection

The Orange Pi 3 LTS comes equipped with a wireless network antenna.
To connect to WiFi through the desktop, click on the WiFi icon in the top right of the monitor display, select your preferred network or hotspot, and enter the password.
