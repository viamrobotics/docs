To use Viam software with your robot, you'll need to install a process called *viam-server* on your robot's computer.

See [What is Viam?](/getting-started/high-level-overview/) for more information.

## Prepare your computer

Make sure your system is compatible with Viam.
Viam is supported on:

- Linux 64-bit operating systems
- Mac OS

If you are using a single board computer (SBC) like a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone, prepare your SBC by following the relevant setup document:

- [Raspberry Pi Setup Guide](/installation/rpi-setup/)
- [BeagleBone AI-64 Setup Guide](/installation/beaglebone-install/)

If you plan to run viam-server on your laptop or desktop with a Linux or Mac operating system, no special prep is required.

## Install viam-server

### Quickstart

1. Go to the <a href="https://app.viam.com/" target="_blank">Viam app</a> and make a new robot.
You can find more detailed instructions in our [Getting Started with the Viam App guide](/getting-started/app-usage/).

2. Click the **SETUP** tab on your robot page.

3. Toggle the **Mode** and **Architecture** settings to be compatible with your device.

4. Follow the steps on the **SETUP** tab.
