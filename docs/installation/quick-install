## Adding your robot on the Viam app

In your web browser, navigate to the Viam app ([app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com)) and log in.

Once you are logged in, a location will be created for you by default, or you can create a new location by filling out the field on the left and then clicking **Add**.
Location are just a way of organizing robots.
You can find more information on [managing robot fleets here](/manage/fleet/#how-to-use-the-viam-app).

Select your location and use the form on the right to create a new Robot.
If this is the first robot in this location, the app displays an arrow pointer to the **New Robot** field (upper RH-corner).
Enter a name for your robot, then click **Add Robot**:
