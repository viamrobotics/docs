How you control `viam-server` will depend on whether or not you installed it as a system service.
Find information for each situation in the tabs below.

{{< tabs name="Starting and stopping viam-server">}}
{{% tab name="Linux"%}}

<br>

### As a system service

After setting up the system service per the [Linux install instructions](/installation#install-viam-server), the AppImage binary will be located at <file>/usr/local/bin/viam-server</file>, and a systemd service file will be placed at <file>/etc/systemd/system/viam-server.service</file>.

By default, the `viam-server` is configured to start when the machine boots.

Sometimes you may want to manually start, stop or restart the `viam-server` systemd service, for instance, when troubleshooting.
You can use the following commands to do so:

Start:

```bash
sudo systemctl start viam-server
```

Stop:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop viam-server
```

Restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart viam-server
```

Enable (start automatically after boot):

```bash
sudo systemctl enable viam-server
```

Disable (do not start automatically after boot):

```bash
sudo systemctl disable viam-server
```

<br>

### From the command line

If you want to run the binary directly, be sure to stop the service first, then run `sudo /usr/local/bin/viam-server path/to/my/config.json`.
Note that on a Raspberry Pi, `viam-server` must always run as root in order to access the DMA subsystem for GPIO.

### Run `viam-server` from the command line

(Recommended method on macOS)

You can run `viam-server` by running the following command, always making sure to replace `<YOUR_ROBOT_NAME>` with the name of your robot from the Viam app.

```bash
viam-server -config ~/Downloads/viam-<YOUR_ROBOT_NAME>-main.json
```

You can also store the config file in a different folder (other than Downloads)--just make sure to run the above command with the correct filepath if you do so.

Hit **Ctrl + C** on your keyboard to stop running `viam-server`.

<br>

### Run as a system service

Installing `viam-server` as a system service is not recommended for most use cases on macOS.
However, if you are looking to create a robot that runs on macOS and you want it to run `viam-server` every time your OS boots up, then you will need to run `viam-server` as a service.
Once you have `viam-server` downloaded locally from Homebrew, you will need to use the following commands to control the service:

Start:

```bash
brew services start viam-server
```

Stop:

```bash
brew services stop viam-server
```

Restart:

```bash
brew services restart viam-server
```

## Troubleshooting

{{< tabs name="Troubleshooting">}}
{{% tab name="Linux" %}}

### View Logs

```bash
sudo journalctl --unit=viam-server
```

If the robot is able to connect with the Viam app, logs can also be viewed in the **LOGS** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).

### SquashFS Errors

Looks like this...

```bash
Feb 10 13:11:26 hydro3-pi viam-server[933]: Something went wrong trying to read the squashfs image.
Feb 10 13:11:26 hydro3-pi viam-server[933]: open dir error: No such file or directory
```

The update process may have been interrupted and left a corrupt file.
Simply redownload the new file as instructed above.

### FUSE Errors

FUSE (Filesystem-in-Userspace), is included in almost all modern Linux distributions by default.
(The one real exception is that it doesnâ€™t work (by default) due to security restrictions within Docker containers.)
For more information on troubleshooting FUSE-related issues (including Docker workarounds) see here: [I get some errors related to something called "FUSE" - AppImage documentation](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/fuse.html).

### View `viam-server` Logs

If you have already successfully connected `viam-server` to the Viam app, you can find all the `viam-server` logs on the **LOGS** tab of the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).

You can also read `viam-server`'s log files locally.

```bash
cat $(brew --prefix)/var/log/viam.log
```
