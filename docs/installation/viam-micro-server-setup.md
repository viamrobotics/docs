To use Viam, you need to install either [the `viam-server` binary](/installation/viam-server-setup/) or `viam-micro-server`.

`viam-micro-server` is a lightweight version of `viam-server` which can run on resource-limited embedded systems that cannot run the fully-featured `viam-server`.
`viam-micro-server` is built from the [micro-RDK](https://github.com/viamrobotics/micro-rdk/).

## Platform requirements

The only microcontroller `viam-micro-server` currently supports is the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32).

{{% readfile "/static/include/micro-rdk-hardware.md" %}}

Proceed to [install `viam-micro-server`](/installation/viam-micro-server-setup/#install-viam-micro-server).

## Install `viam-micro-server`

`viam-micro-server` is the lightweight version of `viam-server` that you can run on ESP32 microcontrollers.

{{% alert title="BETA" color="note" %}}
`viam-micro-server` is in beta mode and many features supported by `viam-server` are still being added to `viam-micro-server`.
Stability is not guaranteed.
Breaking changes are likely to occur, and occur often.
{{% /alert %}}

The `viam-micro-server` installer is a CLI that allows you to flash a build of `viam-micro-server`, along with your machine's credentials and your wifi information, directly to your ESP32.

With this installation, you can use your ESP32 with all supported resource APIs, but you cannot write your own code directly interacting with the chip.
If you want to program the chip directly, follow the setup instructions in [`viam-micro-server` Development Setup](/installation/viam-micro-server-setup/#install-viam-micro-server) instead.

### Flash your ESP32 with the `viam-micro-server` installer

If you have a [compatible microcontroller](#platform-requirements), follow along with the steps outlined below to install `viam-server`:

1. Go to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com). Create an account if you haven't already.

1. Add a new machine by providing a name in the **New machine** field and clicking **Add machine**:

   ![The 'First Location' page on the Viam app with a new machine name in the New machine field and the Add machine button next to the field highlighted.](/fleet/app-usage/create-machine.png)

1. Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab and find your machine's card.
   An alert will be present directing you to **Set up your machine part**:

   ![Machine setup alert in a newly created machine](/installation/setup-part.png)

   Click **View setup instructions** to open the setup instructions.

1. Select **ESP32** as the platform you want to run on.

1. Select the platform you want to use from which to flash the target system.

1. Follow the instructions to use the `micro-rdk-installer` to flash `viam-micro-server` to an ESP32 connected to your computer through a data cable.

1. Once you have followed the steps on the setup instructions, `viam-micro-server` is installed and will run.
   Wait for confirmation that your microcontroller has successfully connected.

   On your machine's page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com), your machine will show that it's **Live**.
   If something is not working, see [Troubleshooting](/installation/viam-micro-server-setup/#troubleshooting).

For more `micro-rdk-installer` CLI usage options, see [GitHub](https://github.com/viamrobotics/micro-rdk/tree/main/micro-rdk-installer).

For code examples and more information on `viam-micro-server`, see [GitHub](https://github.com/viamrobotics/micro-rdk).

### Recommendations when using an SDK

As you use the ESP32, if you write [control code](/sdks/), you may experience instability.
If the connection to the ESP32 with an SDK is unstable, we recommend the following changes to the default settings in your connection code.
This will disable the SDK background task that monitors the connection to `viam-micro-server`, saving bandwidth.

```python
# Replace the connect function found in the CONNECT tab with the following
async def connect():
    opts = RobotClient.Options(
        # viam-micro-server configures once at boot,
        # so we don't need to check if the components have changed
        refresh_interval=0,
        # Checking the connection can safely be disabled

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: IceTransportClosed

If you are trying to connect to an ESP32 and the connection is unstable with the repeating error `E (412486) micro_rdk::common::webrtc::ice: closing ice agent with error IceTransportClosed`, you have opened too many connections to the ESP32, which has a maximum of 3 connections by default.
Make sure you only have one tab with your machine's page open to limit the number of connections to your ESP32.

#### Linux port permissions

If a "Permission Denied" or similar port error occurs, first check the connection of the ESP32 to the machine's USB port.
If connected and the error persists, run `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` to add the current user to the `dialout` group, restart your terminal, and try again.

#### MacOS executable permissions

When using a machine running a version of MacOS, the user is blocked from running the executable by default.
To fix this, **Control+Click** the binary in Finder and then, in the following two prompts select **Open**.
Close whatever terminal window this opens to be able to run the installer.

#### Error: FlashConnect

This may occur because the serial port chosen if/when prompted is incorrect.
However, if the correct port has been selected, try the following:

1. Run the installer as explained above.
2. When prompted to select a serial port:
   1. Hold down the "EN" or enable button on your ESP32.
   2. With the above button held down, select the correct serial port.
   3. Press and hold down the "EN" and "Boot" buttons at the same time. Then release both.

You can find additional assistance in the [Troubleshooting section](/appendix/troubleshooting/).

#### Ubuntu not recognizing the microcontroller

If you’re trying to connect a microcontroller using serial port to an Ubuntu system and the computer doesn’t seem to be recognizing the microcontroller, check if the `brltty` service or its secondary service `brltty-udev` are active (`brltty` is a service installed by default that provides access to a braille display):

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$" data-output="2"}
sudo systemctl status | grep brltty
brltty-udev.service loaded active running Braille Device Support
```

It is a known issue that this service takes ownership of cp210x devices that are used in serial communication with microcontrollers.

To disable the services, run the following:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl stop brltty-udev.service
sudo systemctl mask brltty-udev.service
sudo systemctl stop brltty.service
sudo systemctl disable brltty.service
```

You may also need to reboot your system, and/or unplug the cable from the computer and re-plug it in.

See this [blog post](https://koen.vervloesem.eu/blog/how-to-stop-brltty-from-claiming-your-usb-uart-interface-on-linux/) and [Ubuntu bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/brltty/+bug/1958224) for more.
