Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a way to enforce security in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) by assigning organization members roles that confer permissions.
Users can have access to different fleet management capabilities depending on whether they are an owner or an operator of a given {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organization" >}}, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="location" text="location" >}}, or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machine" >}}.

- **Owner**: Can see and edit [every tab on the machine page](/fleet/machines/#navigating-the-machine-page).
  Can manage users in the app.
- **Operator**: Can see and use only the [**CONTROL**](/fleet/machines/#control) tab.
  Cannot see or edit the [**CONFIGURE**](/fleet/machines/#configure), [**LOGS**](/fleet/machines/#logs), or **CONNECT** tabs.

For more detailed information on the permissions each role confers for different resources, see [Permissions](/fleet/rbac/#permissions).

## Change a user's access

If you have the **Owner** role, you can [invite new users](/fleet/organizations/#invite-someone-to-an-organization) and change the roles assigned to an organization member on a per machine, location, or organization level.

To view the roles each organization member has, click on the organization dropdown in the top navigation bar and click on **Settings**.

### Limit access

To limit the access of a user, first open the access settings for the user by clicking on the user.
Then either change the role of the user from owner to operator with the dropdown or click on **Limit access** and change the resource the user has access.

You can also remove the user by clicking on **Remove user**.

For more information on the permissions the roles assign for each resource, see [Permissions](/fleet/rbac/#permissions).

### Grant additional access

To grant additional access to a user, first open the access settings for the user by clicking on the user.
Then either change the role of the user from operator to owner with the dropdown or click on **Grant additional access** and change the resource the user has access.

{{< imgproc alt="The user invitation menu on the Organization settings page." src="/fleet/app-usage/grant-access.png" resize="800x" declaredimensions=true >}}

For more information on the permissions the roles assign for each resource, see [Permissions](/fleet/rbac/#permissions).

{{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
The option to grant additional access is only visible if you can grant the user additional access.

### Use the mobile app

You can also use the [Viam mobile app](/fleet/#the-viam-mobile-app) to grant or revoke organization owner or operator access to users on the go.
Navigate to your organizations on the mobile app by swiping left to right or clicking on the menu in the top left corner.
Click the gear icon associated with the organization where you want to manage access or invite new people.

## API keys

API keys grant access to organizations, locations, and machines.
If at the organization level, they grant access to all locations and machines contained within that organization.
If at the location level, they grant access to all of the machines contained within that location.

To view all API keys in use for your organization and the locations and machines inside it, click on the organization dropdown in the top navigation bar and click on **Settings**.

View a table with each key, ID, name (if assigned), time created, and entities it provides access to:

{{<imgproc src="/fleet/api-keys.png" resize="700x" declaredimensions=true alt="API Keys table">}}

In each row, click the copy icon to copy the API key and key ID.
Click the duplicate icon to duplicate the API key.
Click the trash can icon to delete the API key.

### Add an API key

Click **Generate key** to generate a new key.
Optionally, give the key a name of your choice.
Click on the **Resource** menu and choose what organization, location, or machine you want the key to grant access to.
For **Role**, assign either an **Owner** or **Operator** role.
See [Permissions](#permissions) for information about the privilege each role entails at each resource level.

### View an API key's details

To view the role of an API key and what it grants access to, click on **Show details** in the key's row of the key table's **Resources** column:

{{<imgproc src="/fleet/additional-details.png" resize="700x" declaredimensions=true alt="Additional details for a key">}}

### Change an API key's access

To edit an API key, click on **Show details** in the key's row of the key table's **Resources** column.

To edit the role, click on the dropdown menu next to the role and select **Owner** or **Operator**.
See [Permissions](#permissions) for information about the privilege each role entails at each resource level.

To change the entities it is able to access, click **+ Grant additional access**.
Select which organization, location, or machine you want the key to grant access to.
Click **Choose** to confirm your selection.

If a user has access to a child location but not its parent location, the user cannot see machines in the parent location.

If a user is an owner of an organization with which a location was shared (that is, a _secondary_ organization owner), that user _can_ share the location with other organizations.

\*Users can only use Try Viam from within an organization they own because doing so creates a new location in the org.
