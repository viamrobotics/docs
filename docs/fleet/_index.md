The [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) provides fleet management allowing you to work on any number of machines alone or in collaboration with others.
You can manage and control your fleet of machines from the Viam app, using the [CLI](/fleet/cli/), or using the [cloud API](/build/program/apis/cloud/).

## Work with groups of machines

With Viam, you can organize {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="smart machines" >}} into {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="location" text="locations" >}} and {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organizations" >}}.

For example, you may have separate organizations for your machines at home and at work:

<img src="/manage/organizations.gif" alt="An organization for personal machines and one for work machines.">

Inside an organization, you can organize machines into one or more locations:

![An image of two locations, New York, and Chicago, in one organization, Good Robots](/fleet/locations.png)

If you are managing a fleet, you can use {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="fragment" text="fragments" >}} when [configuring your machines](/build/configure/), allowing you to use the same configuration for multiple machines.

## Use Viam for collaboration

To facilitate collaboration, you can add collaborators to organizations, manage access, and share locations across multiple organizations.

When you create a Viam account, Viam automatically creates an organization for you.
You can use this organization as your collaboration hub by inviting collaborators to your organization.
You can also add additional organizations as desired at any time.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="caution" >}}
Everyone you invite as an owner to your organization has complete access to everything in that organization.
This includes the permissions to delete machines and locations, as well as the ability to remove you from the organization.
{{< /alert >}}

You can also share locations across different organizations **that you are part of**.

### Permissions

You can assign users different fleet management capabilities by making them an owner or an operator of a given {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organization" >}}, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="location" text="location" >}}, or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machine" >}}.
For more information, see [Permissions](/fleet/rbac/#permissions).

## Collaborate on your machines

Viam is built in a way that allows you to change configurations, deploy packages, check logs, and control your machines both when you are close to your machine, as well as remotely.

Machine [configuration](machines/#configuration) and machine [code](#control-with-the-sdks) is intentionally kept separate, allowing you to keep track of versioning and debug issues separately.

### Configuration

Everyone who has access to the location the machine is in, can change the machine's [configuration](machines/#configuration).

{{< alert title="Simultaneous config edits" color="caution" >}}
If you edit a config while someone else edits the same config, the person who saves last will overwrite any prior changes that aren't reflected in the new config.

Before editing a config, we recommend you refresh the page to ensure you have all the latest changes.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
For some configuration aspects you may require physical access to the machine so you can see how components are connected.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Reconfiguration

When you or your collaborators change the configuration of a machine in the Viam app, `viam-server` automatically synchronizes the configuration to your machine and updates the running resources within 15 seconds.
This means you can add, modify, and remove a modular resource instance from a running machine.

You can see configuration changes made by yourself or by your collaborators on the [History tab](machines/#history).
You can also revert to an earlier configuration from the History tab.

### Package deployment

You and your collaborators can deploy control logic, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="modular-resource" text="modular resources" >}}, sidecar [processes](/build/configure/#processes), or [machine learning models](/ml/) to your fleet of machines without manually copying files by uploading it to Viam's cloud and deploying it to your fleet.

### Remote control

Everyone who has access to the machine can remotely control it in the app's [**CONTROL** tab](machines/#control).
This allows you to visually test and remotely operate machine components and services.

You can also control a machine using the [Viam mobile app](#the-viam-mobile-app).

### Control with the SDKs

Everyone who has access to the machine's location can obtain the machine's remote address and API key from the app's **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page.
You need to include both of these values in your code to send API calls to the machine from the [Viam SDKs](/build/program/apis/).
You can share the machine's remote address and API key without granting location access in the app.

As long as each collaborator has access to these tokens for a machine, members of your team can write code, use tools like GitHub, and execute code to control the machine from anywhere in the world.

Toggle **Include secret** above the code on your machine's **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page to display or hide the machine's API key.
The machine's remote address is displayed on both the **CONTROL** tab and **Code sample** page of your machine's page in the app, ending with `viam.cloud`.

### Logging

Each machine automatically sends logs to the cloud where you can view them from the [**LOGS** tab](machines/#logs).
If you are collaborating on a machine and controlling it using the [**CONTROL** tab](machines/#control) or [SDK code](#control-with-the-sdks), everyone who has access to the location the machine is in can see the machine's logs.

### Deployment

You and your collaborators can deploy [control logic](/build/program/apis/), [modular resources](/registry/), sidecar [processes](/build/configure/#processes), or [machine learning models](/ml/) to your fleet of machines without manually copying files by uploading it to Viam's cloud and deploying it to your fleet.

## The Viam mobile app

In addition to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com), the fully featured web application where you can access all fleet management tools, there is a Viam mobile app.
The mobile app is a convenient way to see if your machine is online, access the [control interface](/fleet/machines/#control), and check machine [logs](/fleet/machines/#logs).

You can find the mobile app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/viam-robotics/id6451424162) and on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viam.viammobile&hl=en&gl=US).
