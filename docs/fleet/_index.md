On the robot page for each member of your fleet, you have the following tabs:

- [Setup](#setup)
- [Config](#config)
- [Logs](#logs)
- [History](#history)
- [Code Sample](#code-sample)
- [Control](#control)
- [Security](#security)

Soon you will also be able to [deploy code and machine learning models](#package-deployment) to robots.

## Setup

The **SETUP** tab contains information for starting an instance of `viam-server` on your robot's computer.
Be sure to select the correct **Mode** and **Architecture** for your system in the upper left of the tab.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
More in-depth information on installing `viam-server` can be found in our [Install Guide](/installation#install-viam-server).
{{% /alert %}}

## Config

On the **CONFIG** tab you can start adding robot {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}}, services, and other robot resources.

For more information, see the [configuration documentation](../configuration/#the-config-tab).

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
If you are managing a large fleet, you can use {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="fragment" text="fragments" >}} when [configuring your robot](../configuration).
{{< /alert >}}

## Logs

The **LOGS** tab displays debug and other logging information from your robot.

Each robot automatically sends logs to the cloud where you can view them from the **LOGS** tab.

## History

The **HISTORY** tab shows a timestamped diff view of your robot's configuration changes.

## Code Sample

The **CODE SAMPLE** tab contains boilerplate code snippets you can copy and paste into your SDK code to connect to your robot.

For more information on the SDKs, see [Program your Robot with Viam's SDKs](../program/sdk-as-client/).

There is also a JSON stub you can copy if you wish to have your robot communicate with another robot as a [remote](../configuration/remotes/).

## Control

The **CONTROL** tab in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) allows you to visually test and remotely operate robot components and services.
For example, if you have configured a base with wheels, you can control your robot's movement with an arrow pad and fields to change baseâ€™s speed.
If you have configured a camera component, a window in the **CONTROL** tab displays the camera output.

If you use remote control in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) UI, all communication to the robot uses [WebRTC](https://pkg.go.dev/go.viam.com/utils@v0.0.3/rpc#hdr-Connection).
For local communication between [parts](../organization/robots#robot-parts) Viam uses gRPC or WebRTC.

## Security

The **SECURITY** tab allows you to access and exchange the **Robot Part Secret Keys** of your robot.
A robot part secret is a unique secret used by the robot to communicate with the cloud.

![The SECURITY tab of a robot`s page noting the Robot Part Secret Keys drop-down menu, with the clipboard icon on the far right and the Generate Key button underneath the drop-down.](img/app-usage/robot-part-secret-keys-drop-down.png)

Copy the secret key by clicking on the clipboard icon.
Click on the **Generate Key** button to generate a new key.

{{% alert title="Caution" color="caution" %}}
Be cautious when sharing robot part secret keys in your code or messages.

Do not make a secret key publicly available, as any entity who has this token has access to your robot, compromising the security of your system.

Note _where_ and _when_ you share a robot part secret key.
After generating a new secret key, remember that it's best practice to update all references to the key in your code as soon as possible, even though Viam supports flexible key rotation with up to two keys in use at one time.

## Package Deployment

_Coming soon._

Deploy control logic, [modular resources](/program/extend/modular-resources/), sidecar [processes](../configuration/processes), or [machine learning models](../data/ml/deploy-model/), to your fleet of robots without manually copying files by uploading it to Viam's cloud and deploying it to your fleet.
