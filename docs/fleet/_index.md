As you scale your fleet of machines, you can use Viam's tools to configure, provision, and monitor your fleet.
You can use {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="fragment" text="fragments" >}} to share configurations across multiple machines.
To provision many machines, use Viam Agent.
To monitor and remotely control machines, use the Viam app **CONTROL** tab or the Viam mobile app.
