A _machine_ is an organizational concept, consisting of either one <em>{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}}</em>, or multiple _parts_ working closely together to complete tasks.
The machine represents the configuration and entry point for one or more computers (and the components they control) coupled into one logical grouping of parts that work together to complete tasks.
A machine usually reflects a physical device, from a camera collecting images, to a wheeled rover, or an articulated arm on a factory floor.
A machine always has a main part that receives client requests, and any number of other parts.

## Add a new machine

Add a new machine by providing a name in the **New machine** field and clicking **Add machine**.

![The 'First Location' page on the Viam app with a new machine name in the New machine field and the Add Machine button next to the field highlighted.](/fleet/app-usage/create-machine.png)

Click the name of a machine to go to that machine's page, where you'll find a variety of tools for working with your machine.

## Navigating the machine page

Next to the machine name, there is an indicator of the machine's status.
Click on the **status** dropdown to open a menu with information about each {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}} of your machine.
Once you connect to the `viam-server` instance on a part, this display includes its OS, Host, `viam-server` version, IP addresses, and what time it was last online or remote address (if live):

### Set up a new machine

<!-- TODO R2D2: might need screenshot and needs to be revisited once setup construction is finished -->

To connect to the `viam-server` instance on a part, follow the setup instructions.
Open the part status dropdown menu in the top left corner of the page, next to the machine's name.
Click **View setup instructions** to open the setup instructions.

Select your system's architecture and select the version of the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="RDK" text="RDK" >}} to use.
Then, follow the instructions on the page to connect and set up your machine.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
The **Micro-RDK** is for [microcontrollers](/get-started/installation/prepare/microcontrollers/).

More in-depth information on installing `viam-server` can be found in our [Install Guide](/get-started/installation/#install-viam-server).
{{% /alert %}}

Once all parts of your machine are set up and connected to the app, the part status display at the top left corner of the page turns green.
Now, you can manage your machine with one of four tabs: **CONFIGURE**, **CONTROL**, **LOGS**, and **CONNECT**:

{{<imgproc src="/fleet/app-usage/parts-live.png" resize="400x" declaredimensions=true alt="The machine page with all parts live">}}

### CONFIGURE

The configuration of a machine describes the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}} that it has access to.
When a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="machine part" >}} that is managed with the Viam app first comes online, it requests its configuration from the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Once the machine has a configuration, it caches it locally and can use the configuration for up to 60 days.
The machine checks for new configurations every 15 seconds and changes its configuration automatically when a new configuration is available.

After connecting your machine, go to the **CONFIGURE** tab, and start adding {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="component" text="components" >}}, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="services" >}}, and other {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}}.

<!-- TODO R2D2: need to check that this works once page is set up -->

To see the history of the configuration of a machine part, click on **History** on the right side of its card on the **CONFIGURE** tab.

For more information, see the [configuration documentation](/build/configure/#the-configure-tab).

{{< alert title="Tip" color="tip" >}}
If you are managing a large fleet, you can use {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="fragment" text="fragments" >}} when [configuring your machine](/build/configure/).
{{< /alert >}}

### CONTROL

Once you have configured components and services for your machine, you can visually test and remotely operate them from the **CONTROL** tab in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
For example, if you have configured a base with wheels, you can control your machine's movement with an arrow pad and fields to change baseâ€™s speed.
If you have configured a camera component, a window in the **CONTROL** tab displays the camera output.

If you use remote control in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) UI, all communication to the machine uses [WebRTC](https://pkg.go.dev/go.viam.com/utils@v0.0.3/rpc#hdr-Connection).
For local communication between [parts](/build/configure/parts/#machine-parts) Viam uses gRPC or WebRTC.

<br>

You can also access the control interface using the [Viam mobile app](/fleet/#the-viam-mobile-app), which you can find on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/viam-robotics/id6451424162) and on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viam.viammobile&hl=en&gl=US).

### LOGS

To make debugging issues with your machines easier, each machine automatically sends its logs to the cloud.
You can access your logs from the **LOGS** tab in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) and filter your logs for specific keywords or log levels:

{{<gif webm_src="/manage/log-filtering.webm" mp4_src="/manage/log-filtering.mp4" alt="Filter logs by term of log level in the UI" max-width="800px">}}

You can click on the part names in the left-hand menu to switch logs between parts. You can also change your timestamp format to ISO or Local depending on your preference.

### CONNECT

#### Code sample

To start programming your machine, go to the **CONNECT** tab and select the **Code sample** page.
This has boilerplate code snippets you can copy and paste into your SDK code to connect to your machine.

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

For more information on the SDKs, see [Program your Machine with Viam's SDKs](/build/program/apis/).

#### Configure as remote part

On the **CONNECT** tab, there is also a page called **Configure as remote part**.
This page has instructions for how to configure a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}} of your machine as a [remote part](/build/configure/parts/) of another machine.

#### API keys

Your machine and the Viam app communicate securely using [WebRTC](https://pkg.go.dev/go.viam.com/utils@v0.0.3/rpc#hdr-Connection) with unique secrets.
The **API keys** page of the **CONNECT** tab allows you to access, generate, and delete your [API keys](/fleet/rbac/#api-keys), which grant access to organizations, locations, and machines.

![The Security tab of a machine's page noting the Machine part API keys dropdown menu, with the clipboard icon on the far right and the Generate Key button underneath the dropdown.](/fleet/app-usage/machine-secrets.png)

Copy an API key or API key ID by clicking on the clipboard icon.
Click **Show details** and **Access settings** to go to your organization settings page, where you can modify the access your API keys provide.

{{% snippet "secret-share.md" %}}

## Delete a machine

Delete a machine by clicking on the **...** menu in the top right hand corner of its page, selecting **Delete machine**, and confirming that you're sure.

{{< imgproc alt="The delete machine button and the confirmation checkbox (Sure?) next to it." src="/fleet/app-usage/delete.png" resize="300x" >}}
