The `tflite_cpu` ML model service allows you to deploy [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) ML models as long as your models adhere to the [model requirements](#model-requirements).
It is supported on any CPU and Linux, Raspbian, MacOS and Android machines.

To work with the `tflite_cpu` ML model service, an ML model is comprised of a <file>.tflite</file> model file which defines the model, and optionally a <file>.txt</file> labels file which provides the text labels for your model.
With the `tflite_cpu` ML model service, you can deploy:

- [a model from the registry](https://app.viam.com/registry)
- a model trained outside the Viam platform that you have [uploaded](/ml/upload-model/)
- a model available on your machine

To configure a `tflite_cpu` ML model service:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Builder" %}}

Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Click the **+** icon next to your machine part in the left-hand menu and select **Service**.
Select the `ML model` type, then select the `TFLite CPU` model.
Enter a name or use the suggested name for your service and click **Create**.

You can choose to configure your service with an existing model on the machine or deploy a model onto your machine:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Deploy Model on Robot" %}}

1. To configure your service and deploy a model onto your machine, select **Deploy model on robot** for the **Deployment** field.

2. Click on **Select models** to open a dropdown with all of the ML models available to you privately, as well as all of the ML models available in [the registry](https://app.viam.com), which are shared by users.
   Models that your organization has trained that are not uploaded to the registry will appear first in the dropdown.
   You can select from any of these models to deploy on your robot.
   Only TensorFlow Lite models are shown.

To see more details about a model, open its page in [the registry](https://app.viam.com).

3. Also, optionally select the **Number of threads**.

{{<imgproc src="/services/deploy-model.png" resize="700x" alt="Create a machine learning models service with a model to be deployed">}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Path to Existing Model On Robot" %}}

1. To configure your service with an existing model on the machine, select **Path to existing model on robot** for the **Deployment** field.
2. Then specify the absolute **Model path** and any **Optional settings** such as the absolute **Label path** and the **Number of threads**.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="JSON Template" %}}

Add the `tflite_cpu` ML model object to the services array in your raw JSON configuration:

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
"services": [
  {
    "name": "<mlmodel_name>",
    "type": "mlmodel",
    "model": "tflite_cpu",
    "attributes": {
      "model_path": "${packages.<model_name>}/<model-name>.tflite",
      "label_path": "${packages.<model_name>}/labels.txt",
      "num_threads": <number>
    }
  },
  ... // Other services
]
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="JSON Example" %}}

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers"}
{
"packages": [
  {
    "package": "39c34811-9999-4fff-bd91-26a0e4e90644/my_fruit_model",
    "version": "YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss",
    "name": "my_fruit_model",
    "type": "ml_model"
  }
], ... // < Insert "components", "modules" etc. >
"services": [
  {
    "name": "fruit_classifier",
    "type": "mlmodel",
    "model": "tflite_cpu",
    "attributes": {
      "model_path": "${packages.my_fruit_model}/my_fruit_model.tflite",
      "label_path": "${packages.my_fruit_model}/labels.txt",
      "num_threads": 1
    }
  }
]
}
```

The `"packages"` array shown above is automatically created when you deploy the model.
You do not need to edit the configuration yourself, expect if you wish to change the [Versioning for deployed models](/ml/deploy/#versioning-for-deployed-models).

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

The following parameters are available for a `"tflite_cpu"` model:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Parameter | Inclusion | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `model_path` | **Required** | The absolute path to the `.tflite model` file, as a `string`. |
| `label_path` | Optional | The absolute path to a `.txt` file that holds class labels for your TFLite model, as a `string`. This text file should contain an ordered listing of class labels. Without this file, classes will read as "1", "2", and so on. |
| `num_threads` | Optional | An integer that defines how many CPU threads to use to run inference. Default: `1`. |

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
If you **Deploy model on robot**, `model_path` and `label_path` will be automatically configured in the format `"${packages.<model_name>}/<model-name>.tflite"` and `"${packages.<model_name>}/labels.txt"` respectively.

If you take the **Path to existing model on robot** approach, your model and label paths do not have to be in the same format.
For example, they might resemble `home/models/fruit/my_fruit_model.tflite`.

Save the configuration.

## Model requirements

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
Models [trained](/ml/train-model/) in the Viam app meet these requirements by design.
{{% /alert %}}

We strongly recommend that you package your TensorFlow Lite model with metadata in [the standard form](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-support/blob/560bc055c2f11772f803916cb9ca23236a80bf9d/tensorflow_lite_support/metadata/metadata_schema.fbs).

In the absence of metadata, your `tflite_cpu` model must satisfy the following requirements:

- A single input tensor representing the image of type UInt8 (expecting values from 0 to 255) or Float 32 (values from -1 to 1).
- At least 3 output tensors (the rest wonâ€™t be read) containing the bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores (in that order).
- Bounding box output tensor must be ordered [x x y y], where x is an x-boundary (xmin or xmax) of the bounding box and the same is true for y.
  Each value should be between 0 and 1, designating the percentage of the image at which the boundary can be found.

These requirements are satisfied by a few publicly available model architectures including EfficientDet, MobileNet, and SSD MobileNet V1.
You can use one of these architectures or build your own.
