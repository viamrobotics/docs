description: "Upload a Machine Learning model to Viam to use it with the ML Model service."
# SME: Steven B.

The ML model service works with models trained inside and outside the Viam app.
To use a model that you have trained yourself outside the Viam app, [upload it as a new model privately or share it in the Viam registry](#upload-a-new-model-or-new-version).
If you need to update a previously uploaded model, you can also [upload a new version](#upload-a-new-model-or-new-version).
To work with the `tflite_cpu` ML model service, an ML model is comprised of a <file>.tflite</file> model file which defines the model, and optionally a <file>.txt</file> labels file which provides the text labels for your model.

If you have [trained](/ml/train-model/) or uploaded an ML model privately and now want to make it available for reuse, you can at any point [make the existing model public in the registry](#make-an-existing-model-public-in-the-registry).

Also, [share a model from your organization](#make-an-existing-model-public-in-the-registry) with other users in the registry.

## Upload a new model or new version

On the [**DATA** tab](https://app.viam.com/data/view) in the Viam app, navigate to the **MODELS** subtab.
Click **Upload model**.

{{<imgproc src="/ml/add-new-model.png" resize="400x" alt="Upload model menu on the DATA tab of the Viam app.">}}

Select if you want to upload a **New model** or a **New version** of a previously published model.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="New model" %}}

Select **Public** to upload the model publicly to the [Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry).
This makes the model usable by any external organization.
See [ML models in the registry](/registry/#ml-models) for more information.

Select **Private** to only publish the model for internal use within this {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organization" >}}.
Select **Next steps** to continue.

{{<imgproc src="/ml/upload-model.png" resize="600x" alt="Upload model menu on the DATA tab of the Viam app.">}}

1. Specify a name for the model.
2. Specify the **Model type**.
3. Add a `.tflite` model file.
4. (Optional) Add a `.txt` label file.
   This should include the label names as you provided them in training, with one name per line.
5. Add a short description.
   This will help other users to understand how to use your model.

Select **Upload model**.
The model is now visible on the **MODELS** subtab of the **DATA** tab in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) and available to [deploy on your machine](/ml/deploy/).
Also, if you selected **Public**, it should be publicly visible in the [Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry).

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="New version" %}}

{{<imgproc src="/ml/select-existing-model.png" resize="400x" alt="Select from your existing models.">}}

1. Select the model you would like to update from your existing models.
2. Select **Next steps** to continue.
3. Add an updated `.tflite` model file.
4. (Optional) Add an updated `.txt` label file.
   This should include the label names as you provided them in training, with one name per line.
5. Click **Upload model**.

Your model is now updated.

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}

If you [deploy a model](/ml/) to a machine, Viam automatically assumes that this is the `latest` version of the model and that you would always like to deploy the `latest` version of the model to the machine.
If you upload a new version of that model, Viam will automatically deploy the new version to the machine and replace the old version.

If you do not want Viam to automatically deploy the `latest` version of the model, you can change the `packages` configuration in the [Raw JSON machine configuration](/build/configure/#the-config-tab).

You can get the version number from a specific model version by navigating to the **MODELS** subtab of the Viam app's **DATA** tab, finding the model's row, clicking on the right-side menu marked with **_..._** and selecting **Copy package JSON**.
The model package config looks like this:

```json
{
  "package": "<model_id>/allblack",
  "version": "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS",
  "name": "<model_name>"
}
```

## Make an existing model public in the registry

To add a model that you've trained to the [Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry) so that other users can deploy it onto their robots:

1. On the [**DATA** tab](https://app.viam.com/data/view) in the Viam app, navigate to the **MODELS** subtab.
   You'll see a list of all ML models you have access to.
2. Open the menu on the right side of an ML model's row.

{{<imgproc src="/ml/model-list.png" resize="1000x" alt="List of models displayed on MODELS subtab of DATA tab.">}}

3. Then, click **Make public in Registry**.

{{<imgproc src="/ml/publish-model.png" resize="600x" alt="Publish model to registry action card.">}}

4. Add a short description.
   This will help other users to understand how to use your model.
5. Then, click **Publish model**.
   Your model is now publicly visible in the [Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry).
