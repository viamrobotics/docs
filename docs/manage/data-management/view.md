After the Data Management Service synchronizes the uploaded data in Viam, you can view it on the [**DATA** page in the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/data/view).

![Images, files, and sensors tabs](../img/data-management/tabs.png)

The **DATA** page shows:

- **IMAGES**: png or jpeg files
- **FILES**: binary data like point cloud data
- **SENSOR DATA**: tabular sensor counts (like gantry position)

If you click on an image or a file, a **Details** panel appears on the right with capture metadata.

## Filter Data

On the [**DATA** page in the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/data/view), you can filter data in the left **FILTERING** panel.

For example, if you specify `Rover Rental` for Location and click **SEARCH**, you can see all data captured on robots that belong to your `Rover Rental` location.

## Next Steps

To export your captured data from the cloud, see [Export Data](../configure-cloud-sync).
