After the Data Management Service synchronizes the uploaded data in Viam, you can view it within the Viam app at [https://app.viam.com/data/view](https://app.viam.com/data/view).

Image (e.g, jpeg and png) data is viewable in the **IMAGES** tab, files and any other binary (e.g, point cloud data) is viewable in the **FILES** tab, and tabular sensor (e.g, gantry position) counts are viewable the **SENSOR DATA** tab.

Clicking on a single image or file shows a **Details** panel on the right with capture metadata.

You can filter on data in the left **FILTERING** panel.
For example, if you specify "kitchen1" for Location, "camera" for Component Type, and click **SEARCH**, you will see all camera data that has been captured on any robots that belong to your "kitchen1" location.
