Data Management is built into Viam.

The Data Management Service captures data from Viam components and securely syncs data to Viam's cloud.
You can configure capture frequency individually for each component.
The service is designed for flexibility and efficiency while preventing data loss, data duplication, and other data management issues.

To read more about the Data Management Service and how to configure it, see [Data Management Service](../../services/data).

Once you have configured data capture and cloud sync, you can [view](view) and [export](export) your data.
