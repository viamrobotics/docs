Data Management is built into Viam allowing you to capture, sync, view, and export data from your robots, as well as use Machine Learning features to enhance your robot's capabilities.

## Capture and sync data

To configure data capture and cloud synchronization, see [Data Management Service](../../services/data).

## Access and export data

Once you have configured data capture and cloud sync, you can [view](view) and [export](export) your data.

## Machine Learning

If you collect image data, you can use it to [train image classification models](train-model) and [deploy these models to your robots](deploy-model).
You can also [upload and use existing models](upload-model).

## Next steps

For a comprehensive tutorial on data capture, synchronization, and accessing captures data, see [Intro to Data Management](../../tutorials/data-management-tutorial).
