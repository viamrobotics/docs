Data Management is built into Viam allowing you to capture, sync, view, and export data from your robots, as well as use Machine Learning features to enhance your robot's capabilities.

## Capture and sync data

To configure data capture and cloud synchronization, see [Data Management Service](../../services/data).

## Access and export data

Once you have configured data capture and cloud sync, you can [view](view) and [export](export) your data.

## Machine Learning

To use collected data to train machine learning models or use existing models on your robots, see [Machine Learning](../ml).

## Next steps

For a comprehensive tutorial on data capture, synchronization, and accessing captures data, see [Intro to Data Management](../../tutorials/services/data-management-tutorial).
