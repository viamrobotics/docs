Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a way to enforce security in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) by assigning organization members or API keys roles that confer permissions.
You can assign an owner or an operator role for an {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organization" >}}, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="location" text="location" >}}, or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machine" >}}.

- **Owner**: Can see and edit every tab on the machine page and perform equivalent operations from the APIs.
- **Operator**: Can see and use only the [**CONTROL**](/manage/troubleshoot/teleoperate/default-interface/#viam-app) tab and perform equivalent operations from the APIs.
  Cannot see or edit the **CONFIGURE**, [**LOGS**](/manage/troubleshoot/troubleshoot/#check-logs), or **CONNECT** tabs.

The following sections describe the permissions for each user role when it comes to managing machines, locations, organizations, fragments, and data.

## Machines

Permissions for managing {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machines" >}} are as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Permissions | Org owner | Org operator | Location owner | Location operator | Machine owner | Machine operator |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Control the machine from the **CONTROL** tab | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| See all tabs (such as **CONFIGURE** and **LOGS**) | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No |
| Edit machine name | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No |
| Delete the machine | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No |
| Add a new {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}} | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No |
| Edit {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}} name | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No |
| Restart the machine | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No |
| Edit a machine config (including data capture and sync) | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No |

## Locations

Permissions for managing {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="location" text="locations" >}} are as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Permissions | Org owner | Org operator | Location owner | Location operator | Machine owner | Machine operator |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Edit location info (rename, delete location) | **Yes** | No | **Yes** for this and any child locations | No | No | No |
| Create a new machine | **Yes** | No | **Yes** in this and any child locations | No | No | No |
| Move the location (to new parent location) | **Yes** | No | **Yes**, to other locations they have access to | No | No | No |
| Create a new location in the organization | **Yes** | No | No | No | No | No |
| Delete location | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Add/remove Viam support team permissions | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Add a shared location | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Remove a shared location | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Use Try Viam from within the org\* | **Yes** | No | No | No | No | No |

If a user has access to a child location but not its parent location, the user cannot see machines in the parent location.

If a user is an owner of an organization with which a location was shared (that is, a _secondary_ organization owner), that user _can_ share the location with other organizations.

\*Users can only use Try Viam from within an organization they own because doing so creates a new location in the org.

## Organization settings and roles

Only {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organization" >}} owners can edit or delete an organization, or see and edit the organization billing page.

Permissions for managing org settings and user roles are as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Permissions | Org owner | Org operator | Location owner | Location operator | Machine owner | Machine operator |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| See billing page | **Yes** | No | No | No | No | No |
| Get billing-related emails | **Yes** | No | No | No | No | No |
