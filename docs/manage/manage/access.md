To collaborate with others on your machines, you can grant users permissions for individual machines or entire locations.
You can use the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) or the [Viam mobile app](/manage/troubleshoot/teleoperate/default-interface/#viam-mobile-app) to grant or revoke organization owner or operator access to users or API keys.

2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Find the **Members** section of the organization settings page.

5. Enter a user's **Email** address.

6. Select an {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="organization" text="organization" >}}, a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="location" text="location" >}}, or a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machine" >}} as the **Resource** to share.

   Users with access to a location or organization can collaborate on the [machines](/operate/get-started/basics/#what-is-a-machine) within it.

## Collaborate safely

When you or your collaborators change the configuration of a machine or a group of machines in the Viam app, `viam-server` automatically synchronizes the configuration and updates the running resources within 15 seconds.
This means everyone who has access can change a fleet's configuration, even while your machines are running.

You can see configuration changes made by yourself or by your collaborators by selecting **History** on the right side of your machine part's card on the **CONFIGURE** tab.
You can also revert to an earlier configuration from the History tab.

{{< alert title="Simultaneous config edits" color="caution" >}}
If you edit a config while someone else edits the same config, the person who saves last will overwrite any prior changes that aren't reflected in the new config.

Before editing a config, we recommend you refresh the page to ensure you have all the latest changes.
{{< /alert >}}

Machine [configuration](/operate/get-started/supported-hardware/) and machine [code](/dev/reference/sdks/) is intentionally kept separate, allowing you to keep track of versioning and debug issues separately.
