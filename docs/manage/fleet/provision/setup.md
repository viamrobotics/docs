## Decide on the provisioning method

You can choose to let your end users complete machine setup by using:

- A captive web portal accessed through the machine's WiFi hotspot
- The Viam mobile app using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) provisioning, which shows device info like manufacturer, model and fragment ID
- Both methods simultaneously for maximum flexibility
