An organization is a group of one or more locations that helps you organize your fleet.

An organization is the highest level grouping in the Viam platform, which generally represents a company, or other institution.
You can also use organizations for departments or other entities that can have one or more [locations](/manage/fleet/locations).
If you are familiar with Google Drive, you can think of an organization as a shared drive.

When you or another user registers for an account with Viam, they become a member of an organization.
If the user was invited to an organization, they become a part of that organization.
If the user registered without invitation, an organization and a [location](/manage/fleet#locations) is automatically created for the user.

A user can create more organizations at any time.

Any member of an organization can invite new users to that organization.

For example, you may have an account with one organization for your personal robots at home and another organization for the robots at work.

You organization is shown in the upper right corner of the Viam app.
If you click on the organization drop down, the app displays your name, email, and a list of organizations you belong to.
