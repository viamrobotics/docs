An organizational concept, consisting of either one _part_, or multiple _parts_ working closely together to complete tasks.
The robot represents the configuration and entry point for one or more computers (and the components they control) coupled into one logical grouping of parts that work together to complete tasks.
A robot usually reflects a physical device, from a camera collecting images, to a wheeled rover, or an articulated arm on a factory floor.
A robot always has a main part that receives client requests, and any number of other parts.
