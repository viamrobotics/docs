You can view all machines in an organization from a dashboard and access each machine from it.

**1. Monitor your fleet's parts statuses and synced data**

You can monitor your machines from your **FLEET**'s [**ALL MACHINES DASHBOARD** subtab](https://app.viam.com/fleet/machines).

You can also monitor the amount of binary and tabular data your fleet has synced in the last 48 hours from the **FLEET**'s [**DASHBOARD** subtab](https://app.viam.com/fleet/dashboard).

**2. Investigate machine status**

If you click on a machine part, you can get more information about the machine.
At the top of the machine page, there is an indicator of the machine's status.
Click on the **status** dropdown to open a menu with information about each {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="part" text="part" >}} of your machine.
Once you connect to the `viam-server` instance on a part, this display includes its OS, Host, `viam-server` version, IP addresses, and what time it was last online or remote address (if live):

**3. Test your machines remotely**

On a machine's [**CONTROL** tab](/manage/troubleshoot/teleoperate/default-interface/#viam-app), you can remotely operate the machine and test its resources.
