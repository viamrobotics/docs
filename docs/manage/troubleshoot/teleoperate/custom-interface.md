You can remotely operate any configured machine and visualize and aggregate its data using a custom control interface by creating a teleop workspace.

### Prerequisites

{{% expand "A configured machine with teleoperable components" %}}

Make sure your machine has at least one camera, movement sensor, sensor, base, arm, board, gantry, gripper, motor or servo.

See [configure a machine](/operate/get-started/supported-hardware/) for more information.

### Configure a workspace

**1. Create a workspace in the Viam app**

Log in to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).

Navigate to the **FLEET** page's **TELEOP** tab.
Create a workspace by clicking **+ Create workspace**.
Give it a name.

**2. Add widgets**

Click **Add widget** and select the appropriate widget for your machine.
Repeat as many times as necessary.

Now your workspace setup is complete:

{{<imgproc src="/how-tos/teleop/configured-workspace.png" resize="700x" style="width: 500px" class="fill aligncenter" declaredimensions=true alt="Teleop workspace with values configured for each of the four widgets.">}}

**3. Select a machine**

Now, select a machine with which to make your teleop workspace come to life.
Select **Monitor** in the top right corner to leave editing mode.
Click **Select machine** and select your configured machine.

Your dashboard now shows the configured widgets for the data from your machine:

{{<imgproc src="/how-tos/teleop/full-workspace.png" resize="900x" style="width: 500px" class="fill aligncenter imgzoom" declaredimensions=true alt="Teleop workspace with values configured for each of the four widgets on monitor mode.">}}

You can go back to **Edit** mode and drag and drop the widgets' panes around to edit their appearance.
For example:

{{<imgproc src="/how-tos/teleop/four-panes.png" resize="900x" style="width: 500px" class="fill aligncenter imgzoom" declaredimensions=true alt="Teleop workspace with values configured for each of the four widgets on monitor mode with four panes.">}}
