You can remotely control, test, and operate any configured machine using the default control interface

## Viam app

The **CONTROL** tab provides a control interface for each component and service that you have configured for you machine.

For example, if you have configured a base with wheels, you can move your machine's with an arrow pad and control the base's speed by setting its power with a slider.
If you have configured a camera component, a window in the **CONTROL** tab displays the camera output.

You can also switch between different machine parts directly from the **CONTROL** tab and control the selected machine part.

## Viam mobile app

In addition to the Viam app, the [Viam mobile app](/manage/troubleshoot/teleoperate/default-interface/#viam-mobile-app) also allows you to test, monitor and remotely operate machines in your fleet.

For example, you can view live camera feeds, adjust components' runtime parameters, and switch between controllable components.

Additionally, the app allows you to:

- see if your machines are online
- [view a machine's logs](/manage/troubleshoot/troubleshoot/#check-logs)
- [upload images from your phone to the cloud](/data-ai/ai/advanced/upload-external-data/#upload-images-with-the-viam-mobile-app)
- [invite people to collaborate with you and modify access](/manage/troubleshoot/teleoperate/default-interface/#viam-mobile-app)
