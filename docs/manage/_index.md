You can use Viam's cloud-based fleet management tools to monitor and manage access to your fleet of {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="smart-machine" text="smart machines" >}}.
Use these tools as you create and scale a new fleet of smart machines, or integrate Viam to manage and add functionality like data management to your existing fleet.

For example, you might have 30 robots in one warehouse and 500 in another.
You can monitor and teleoperate all of the robots from one online dashboard, and grant permission to other users to do the same.
You can grant users different levels of access to individual machines or to groups of machines.
