The [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/) is a web UI for managing and building robots.

## Create Account and Log In

To get started on the Viam app, you must log in as an authorized user.
Navigate to [the main page](https://app.viam.com/).
If you haven't already, click **Sign Up** to create a new user.
Select **Log In** to log in to the app with your Google credentials, or provide your Email address and choose a password.

If you forget your password to the app, click **Forgot password** and enter your email address to obtain instructions to reset your password.

## Manage

You do not have to use the app to use Viam's platform to build your robot, but it has several key features to help you get started managing your robots, including configuring robots with more complicated architecture like sub-parts or remotes:

{{< cards >}}
  {{% card link="/manage/configuration" size="small" %}}
  {{% card link="/manage/fleet" size="small" %}}
  {{% card link="/manage/data" size="small" %}}
  {{% card link="/manage/ml" size="small" %}}
  {{% card link="/manage/parts-and-remotes" size="small" %}}
{{< /cards >}}

You can also manage and control your robots from the command line with our CLI:

{{< cards >}}
  {{% card link="/manage/cli" size="small" %}}
{{< /cards >}}
