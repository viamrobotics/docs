The [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/) is a web UI for managing and building machines.
To use the app, you need a free account.
Accounts can have [different permissions](/manage/manage/rbac/) to different groups of machines.

## Create account and log in

To get started on the Viam app, you must log in as an authorized user.
Viam supports sign-up using Google, GitHub, Apple, and email.

Navigate to [the main page](https://app.viam.com/).
If you haven't created an account yet, click **Sign Up** to create a new account using your preferred single sign-on method or your email address and a password.
If you already have an account, click **Log In** to log in using your single sign-on credentials or your email address and password.

If you forget your password to the app, click **Forgot password** and enter your email address to obtain instructions to reset your password.
