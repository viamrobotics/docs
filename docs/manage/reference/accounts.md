Viam has a [web UI](https://app.viam.com/) for managing and building machines.
To use Viam, you need a free account.
Accounts can have [different permissions](/manage/manage/rbac/) to different groups of machines.

## Create account and log in

To get started, you must log in with a Viam account.
Viam supports sign-up using Google, GitHub, Apple, and email.

Navigate to [the main page](https://app.viam.com/).
If you haven't created an account yet, click **Sign Up** to create a new account using your preferred single sign-on method or your email address and a password.
If you already have an account, click **Log In** to log in using your single sign-on credentials or your email address and password.

If you forget your password to the app, click **Forgot password** and enter your email address to obtain instructions to reset your password.

Accounts created from separate authentication sources are unique to each other.

Once you have logged in, get started by [creating a machine](/operate/install/setup/).
