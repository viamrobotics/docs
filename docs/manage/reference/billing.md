## Replace credit card payment method

To replace the credit card payment method for an organization, the billing person must have access to the organization's billing settings. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create an account

If the billing person doesn't already have a Viam account:

1. Go to [app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com)
2. Create a new account using the billing person's email address

### 2. Request access to the organization

The billing person needs to be granted access to the organization that requires the payment method change:

1. An existing organization owner should navigate to the organization settings:
   - Click on the organization dropdown in the top right corner
   - Select **Settings**
2. In the **Members** section, click **Grant access**
3. Enter the billing person's email address
4. Select the organization as the **Entity** to share
5. Assign the **Owner** role (required for billing access)
6. Click **Invite**

Alternatively, the billing person can request an invite by providing their email address to an existing organization owner.

### 3. Access payment and billing settings

Once the billing person has organization access:

1. Log in to [app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com)
2. Click on the organization dropdown in the top right corner
3. Select **Payment and billing**

### 4. Remove existing payment method

1. On the **Payment and billing** page, locate the current payment method
2. Click **Remove payment method**
3. Confirm the removal when prompted

### 5. Add new payment method

1. Click **Add payment method**
2. Enter the new credit card information:
   - Card number
   - Expiration date
   - CVV/CVC code
   - Billing address
3. Click **Save** or **Add payment method** to complete the process
