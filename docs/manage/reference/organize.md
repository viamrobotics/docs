Before you start connecting your devices to the Viam app, you need to decide how you want to group your machines.

In the Viam app, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machines" >}} are grouped into _locations_, and locations are grouped into _organizations_:

- Each location can represent either a physical location or some other conceptual grouping like "Production" and "Testing".
- An organization is the highest level grouping, and often contains all the locations (and machines) of an entire company.

These groupings allow you to manage permissions; you can grant a user access to an individual machine, to all the machines in a location, or to everything in an entire organization.
You choose how to group your machines.
You cannot move machines to other locations once created.

{{% hiddencontent %}}
It is also not possible to change the location of a robot with an SDK.
{{% /hiddencontent %}}

If you want to have the machine in a different location, you will need to create a new machine and copy the old machine's configuration to the new machine.

### Can I move a location to a different organization?

No, it is not possible to move a location to a different organization.

You can share a location with another organization.
However, machines will continue to use the primary organization as a reference point.
This means any captured data is associated with the primary organization and the machines are only able to use private ML models and registry items from the primary owner.

### Can I rename my organization after its creation?

Yes, you can rename your organization if you are an organization owner.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="caution" >}}
If your organization owns modules or packages in the Viam Registry, the namespace for those modules and packages will be changed in the registry automatically.
You will need to update any configurations that reference your modules using the old namespace.
