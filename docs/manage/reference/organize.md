Before you start connecting your devices to the Viam app, you need to decide how you want to group your machines.

In the Viam app, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machines" >}} are grouped into _locations_, and locations are grouped into _organizations_:

- Each location can represent either a physical location or some other conceptual grouping like "Production" and "Testing".
- An organization is the highest level grouping, and often contains all the locations (and machines) of an entire company.

These groupings allow you to manage permissions; you can grant a user access to an individual machine, to all the machines in a location, or to everything in an entire organization.
You choose how to group your machines.
You cannot move machines to other locations once created.

If needed, you can add further sub-locations to, for example, differentiate groups of machines within an office.

To add a sub-location:

1. Add a new location using the same **Add location** button.

1. At the bottom of the locationâ€™s page, use the **New parent location** dropdown to choose a parent location.
   Click **Change**.

The left Locations navigation panel lists Antonia's Home and RobotsRUs, with New York Office and Oregon Office nested inside RobotsRUs." >}}

You can nest locations up to three levels deep.
