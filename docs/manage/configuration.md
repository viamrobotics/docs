Configuration is the process of telling your robot what *resources* (hardware [components](/components/) and software [services](/services/)) it has access to, and the relevant parameters of those resources, so that the robot software knows how to interact with its resources.

You can find specifics on how to configure a resource of a given type and model in its respective documentation:

- [Find all component types here.](/components/)
- [Find all service types here.](/services/)

However, this page details some overarching concepts and best practices.
