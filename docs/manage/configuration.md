Before you can program a robot, you must configure it.

A robot's configuration tells the code running the robot what *resources* (hardware *components* and software *services*) it has access to, as well as any relevant parameters for those resources.

## Your robot's config file

The configuration file contains sections for components and services, as well as any modules, remotes, processes and frames you configure.

Viam robot configuration files are written in [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

When you turn on your robot, `viam-server` starts up and looks in its local <file>/etc/viam.json</file> for its configuration information.
The <file>/etc/viam.json</file> file will contain one of two things:

- If you set up your robot to connect to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) by following the steps on the **SETUP** tab, this file will contain the credentials for your robot to get its full config from the Viam app.
Step 1 on the **SETUP** tab alters this file.
For example,

  ```json
  {"cloud":{"app_address":"https://app.viam.com:123","id":"123456ab-a1b2-12a3-a123-1a2b345cdefg6",
  "secret":"ab0cd0efghijkl0m12no3pqrstuvw0xyza4bcd567891abcd"}}
  ```

  Look at the **CONFIG** tab on your robot's page to view and edit the full config file showing components and services.

- If you write your config file locally without connecting to the Viam app, <file>/etc/viam.json</file> contains your full config file.
  Technically, you can put your config file anywhere you want as long as when starting `viam-server`, you pass in the path to the config file.
  <file>/etc/viam.json</file> is just the default location.

## The CONFIG tab

The **CONFIG** tab is a central feature of your robot's page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).

You can use the mode selector to switch between **Builder** and **Raw JSON**:

- **Builder** mode provides a graphical interface for configuring your robot resources.
It generates properly formatted JSON for you.
- **Raw JSON** mode provides a text editing field where you can write and edit the full config manually.
It can be convenient to view a large config in raw JSON mode because all the components, services, modules and more that you configure in individual tabs of builder mode will appear in one long file in raw JSON mode.
You can also copy and paste the raw JSON if needed.

![The CONFIG tab of the Viam app with a box highlighting the CONFIG tab and the Mode selector (where you can select Builder or Raw JSON).](../img/configuration/config-tab.png)

If you add components in **Builder** mode and click **Save Config** at the bottom of the screen, you can switch to **Raw JSON** and see the JSON that has been generated by the builder.

The sections of the robot config (which each have corresponding sub-tabs on the **CONFIG** tab) are as follows:

## Components

Components represent the pieces of hardware on your robot that you want to control with Viam.

You must configure each component with a name, a model, a type, attributes, and dependencies:

- `name`: Serves as an identifier when accessing the resource from your code, as well as when configuring other resources that are dependent on that resource.
You can choose any unique name for a component.

- `type`: The broad component category, such as `motor`, `arm` or `camera`.
  Components of a given type have a common API.

- `model`: Indicates the more specific category of hardware.
Components of the same model are supported using the same low-level code.

- `attributes`: A struct to define things like how the component is wired to the robot, its dimensions, and other specifications; attributes vary widely between models.
  See the [component documentation](/components/) for a given component type and model for more details.

- `depends_on`: Any components that a given component relies upon, and that must be initialized on boot before this component is initialized.
  Many built-in components have convenient implicit dependencies, in which case `depends_on` can be left blank.
  For example, a [`gpio` motor](/components/motor/gpio/) depends on the `board` to which it is wired, but it has a dedicated `board` attribute and `viam-server` will automatically initialize that board before it looks for the motor.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
Find specific information on how to configure each supported component type in its respective [documentation](/components/).
{{% /alert %}}

When you configure a component on the **CONFIG** tab, it will also appear on the **CONTROL** tab which gives you an interface to test and interact with it.
Meanwhile the **CODE SAMPLE** tab will also update to include code for some basic interaction with that component using the Viam [SDKs](/program/sdk-as-client/).

## Services

[Services](/services/) are built-in software packages that make it easier to add complex capabilities such as motion planning or object detection to your robot.

For services, the `type` specifies which of the Viam services you want to use on your robot, such as the Vision Service or the Motion Service.

The `name` serves as an identifier when accessing the resource from your code, as well as when configuring other resources that are dependent on that resource.
You can choose any unique name for a service.

The other aspects of configuring a service are highly specific to the type of service.
See the [services documentation](/services/) for more information.

## Modules

[Modular resources](/program/extend/modular-resources/) are a way to add resource types or models that are not built into Viam.

To add a modular resource as a component or service of your robot, configure a module per the [modular resource documentation](/program/extend/modular-resources/#add-a-module-to-your-robot-configuration).

## Remotes

Configuring a remote is a way to connect two separate robots so one can access the resources of the other.
Find more information in our remotes documentation.

## Processes

To automatically run a specified script when the robot boots, configure a *process*.

Start by giving the process a **Name** (`id` in raw JSON) (an identifier of your choice) and clicking **Create Process**.

Then fill in the following fields:

- **Executable** (`name`): The command you want to execute when your robot connects to the server.
- **Arguments** (`args`): Optional arguments to follow the command.
- **Working Directory** (`cwd`): Where you want the process to execute.
  An optional setting that defaults to the directory where `viam-server` executes.

You can also toggle whether you want errors and other messages to be logged, and whether to execute the command just once or keep running the process indefinitely.
In raw JSON, these options are represented by `log` (bool) and `one_shot` (bool), respectively.

{{% expand "Click to see an example of a configured process." %}}

The following configuration executes the command `python3 my_cool_script.py` in your <file>/home/myName/project/</file> directory every time your robot boots, and keeps it executing indefinitely.

![The PROCESSES sub-tab of the CONFIG tab with a process called run-my-code configured. The executable is python3, the argument is my_cool_script.py, and the working directory is /home/myName/project. Logging is turned on and execute once is turned off.](../img/configuration/process-fancy.png)

The corresponding raw JSON looks like this:

```json
"processes": [
    {
      "id": "run-my-code",
      "log": true,
      "name": "python3",
      "args": [
        "my_cool_script.py"
      ],
      "cwd": "/home/myName/project/"
    }
  ]
```

## Fragments

{{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
Fragments are an experimental feature.
Stability is not guaranteed.
{{< /alert >}}

Fragments are a way of sharing and managing identical configuration files (or parts of config files) across multiple robots.
For example, if you have multiple robots with the same hardware, wired the same way, you can create and share a fragment and add it to any number of robots.
When changes are made to the fragment, those changes are automatically carried to all robots that include the fragment in their config.

You can add a fragment to a robot's config and also add other configuration outside the fragment.
For example, if you have multiple identical rovers but one has an arm attached, you can add the rover configuration fragment (including the motors and base components), and then configure the arm on just that one rover.

To add a fragment to a robot:

- Go to the **FRAGMENTS** sub-tab of your robot's **CONFIG** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
- Look through the list of available fragments and click **ADD** next to any fragments you want to add to your robot.
- Click **Save Config** at the bottom of the screen.

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}

The components or other resources included in the fragment will *not* appear in the **COMPONENTS** sub-tab or in the `components` section of your config.
You will simply see the fragment ID in the `fragments` section of your config, but all the resources *will* appear on the **CONTROL** tab when your robot comes on line, and they will be accessible from SDK code as regular resources of your robot.

{{% /alert %}}

To create a fragment, go to [app.viam.com/fragments](https://app.viam.com/fragments).

For an example of adding a fragment to a robot, see the [Viam Rover fragment tutorial](/try-viam/rover-resources/rover-tutorial-fragments/).

## Frame system

The frame system holds reference frame information for the relative position of components in space.

Configure a frame for a given component on its panel on the **COMPONENTS** tab, then switch to the **FRAME SYSTEM** tab to visualize the relative positions.
Find more information in the [frame system documentation](/services/frame-system/).


## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, here are some things to try:

- Check the **LOGS** tab to check for any errors or other info from `viam-server`.
- You can also view logs locally by running the following command on the robot:
  
  {{< tabs >}}
  {{% tab name="Linux" %}}

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl --unit=viam-server
  ```

  {{% /tab %}}
  {{% tab name="macOS" %}}

  ```bash
  cat $(brew --prefix)/var/log/viam.log
  ```

  {{% /tab %}}
  {{< /tabs >}}

- Make sure all configured components are actually saved to your config.
   If they aren't, you will see an **Unsaved Changes** note next to the **Save Config** button at the bottom of the config screen.
- Try restarting `viam-server` by clicking **Restart** in the upper right corner of the app.
   It takes a few minutes for the server to shut down and restart.
- Make sure the issue is not hardware related.
  Some things to check are that the robot has adequate power, all wires are properly connected, and no chips or other hardware components are shorted or overheated.

## Next Steps

After configuring your robot, you can use the [Viam SDKs](../../program/sdk-as-client/) to program and control your robot.
