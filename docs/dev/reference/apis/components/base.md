The base component supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your base and the rest of your machine, go to your machine's page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com),
Navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

When executed, this sample code creates a connection to your machine as a client.

The following examples assume you have a wheeled base called `"my_base"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your base has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Import the base package for the SDK you are using:

)
