The board API allows you to give commands to your [board components](/operate/reference/components/board/) for setting GPIO pins to high or low, setting PWM, and working with analog and digital interrupts.

The board component supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your board and the rest of your machine, go to your machine's page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com),
Navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

{{% snippet "show-secret.md" %}}

When executed, this sample code will create a connection to your machine as a client.
Then control your machine programmatically by getting your `board` component from the machine with `FromRobot` and adding API method calls, as shown in the following examples.

The following examples assume you have a board called `"my_board"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your board has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Import the board package for the SDK you are using:
