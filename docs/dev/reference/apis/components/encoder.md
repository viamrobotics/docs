The encoder API allows you to give commands to your [encoder components](/operate/reference/components/encoder/) for getting the position of a motor or a joint in ticks or degrees.

The encoder component supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your encoder and the rest of your machine, go to your machine's page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com),
Navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

When executed, this sample code creates a connection to your machine as a client.

The following examples assume you have an encoder called `"my_encoder"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your encoder has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Import the encoder package for the SDK you are using:
