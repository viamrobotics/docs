The camera API allows you to give commands to your [camera components](/operate/reference/components/camera/) for getting images or point clouds.

The API for camera components allows you to:

- Request single images or a stream in 2D color, or display z-depth.
- Request a point cloud.
  Each 3D point cloud image consists of a set of coordinates (x,y,z) representing depth in mm.

The camera component supports the following methods:

## Establish a connection

To get started using Viam's SDKs to connect to and control your camera and the rest of your machine, go to your machine's page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com),
Navigate to the **CONNECT** tab's **Code sample** page, select your preferred programming language, and copy the sample code.

When executed, this sample code creates a connection to your machine as a client.

The following examples assume you have a camera called `"my_camera"` configured as a component of your machine.
If your camera has a different name, change the `name` in the code.

Import the camera package for the SDK you are using:
