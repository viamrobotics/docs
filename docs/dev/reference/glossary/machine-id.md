A **Machine ID** is a unique identifier assigned to each {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machine" >}} in the Viam platform.
This ID is used to identify and reference a specific machine within the Viam ecosystem.

Machine IDs are automatically generated when a new machine is created on Viam.
You can get it using the web UI and the [Fleet management API](/dev/reference/apis/fleet/).
