Jobs are automated tasks that run on machines at specified intervals to perform routine operations such as data collection, sensor readings, maintenance operations, and system checks.

The job scheduler is built into `viam-server` and executes configured jobs according to their specified schedules.
Each job targets a specific resource on your machine and calls a designated method at the scheduled intervals.

For more information, see [Schedule automated jobs](/manage/software/scheduled-jobs/).
