The world reference [frame](/operate/reference/services/frame-system/) is the fixed, global coordinate system that serves as the reference point for all other coordinate frames in a robotic system.
It provides a consistent basis for describing the position and orientation of robots, components, and objects in the physical space.
All other coordinate frames (such as machine frames and component frames) are defined relative to this world frame, either directly or through a chain of transformations.

The user chooses the world frame, and defines it implicitly.
For example, if you have a robot arm mounted on a table and you define the arm's base frame as the world frame, then the arm's base frame is the origin of the world frame.
