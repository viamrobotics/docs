The origin frame is the frame at the base of an arm, gantry, or other component that has a complex kinematics chain.
This is typically the point at the center of where the component is mounted to a table or stand.

Every component that has a kinematics chain has an origin frame and an end effector frame, for example `my_arm_origin` and `my_arm`.

If you parent a gripper to the arm's `my_arm` frame, the frame system will know the gripper is at the end of the arm.
If you mistakenly parent the gripper to the arm's `my_arm_origin` frame, the frame system will think the gripper is at the base of the arm, and the gripper will not move when you move the arm.
