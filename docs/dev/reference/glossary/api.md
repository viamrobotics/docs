API stands for application programming interface.
An API defines the methods and data structures that allow different software components or systems to communicate with each other.

In the Viam platform, APIs are used extensively to:

- Control hardware components (motors, cameras, sensors, etc.)
- Access services (vision, motion, navigation, etc.)
- Manage machines and organizations
- Process and analyze data

Viam provides several types of APIs:

- **Robot API**: For controlling individual machines and their components
- **App API**: For managing organizations, locations, and machines
- **Data API**: For accessing and analyzing data collected from machines
- **ML Training API**: For training machine learning models

These APIs are accessible through various {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="sdk" text="SDKs" >}} (Software Development Kits) in languages like Python, Go, and TypeScript, allowing developers to build applications that interact with Viam-enabled machines.
