**Pi** is short for **Raspberry Pi**, a series of small, affordable single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. These credit card-sized computers are widely used in robotics, IoT projects, education, and DIY electronics.

Key characteristics of Raspberry Pi boards include:

- Low cost and small form factor
- ARM-based processors
- GPIO pins for connecting to electronic components and sensors
- Support for various operating systems, primarily Linux-based distributions
- Built-in connectivity options (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet)
- Ability to interface with cameras, displays, and other peripherals

The Viam platform supports Raspberry Pi devices as host computers for running `viam-server`, making them popular choices for building robots and smart machines. Viam provides [specific setup instructions](/operate/reference/prepare/rpi-setup/) for Raspberry Pi devices.

Common Raspberry Pi models used with Viam include:

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

When someone mentions "flashing a Pi" or "setting up a Pi," they're referring to installing an operating system or software on a Raspberry Pi device.
