**Pi** is short for **Raspberry Pi**, a series of small, affordable single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. These credit card-sized computers are widely used in robotics, IoT projects, education, and DIY electronics.

The Viam platform supports Raspberry Pi devices as host computers for running `viam-server`, making them popular choices for building robots and smart machines.

When someone mentions "flashing a Pi" or "setting up a Pi," they're referring to installing an operating system or software on a Raspberry Pi device.
To set up a Raspberry Pi, see [the Raspberry Pi setup instructions](/operate/reference/prepare/rpi-setup/).
