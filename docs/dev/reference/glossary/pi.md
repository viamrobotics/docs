Pi is short for Raspberry Pi, a series of small, affordable single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
These credit card-sized computers are widely used in robotics, IoT projects, education, and DIY electronics.

Viam supports many different devices including Raspberry Pis as host computers for running `viam-server`.

To set up a Raspberry Pi, see [the Raspberry Pi setup instructions](/operate/reference/prepare/rpi-setup/).
