ML stands for **Machine Learning**, a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. 

In the context of robotics and the Viam platform, ML is used for various applications including:

- Computer vision (object detection, classification, segmentation)
- Predictive maintenance
- Motion planning
- Autonomous navigation
- Sensor data processing

Viam provides tools for [training ML models](/data-ai/ai/train/), [deploying them to machines](/data-ai/ai/deploy/), and [running inference](/data-ai/ai/run-inference/) to enable intelligent behavior in robotic systems.
