ML stands for machine learning, a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.

Viam provides tools for [training ML models](/data-ai/ai/train/), [deploying them to machines](/data-ai/ai/deploy/), [running inference](/data-ai/inference/), and [interpret visual data from cameras](/data-ai/inference/alert/) to enable intelligent behavior in robotic systems.
