A trigger is a mechanism that sends alerts by email or webhook when specific events occur in your machine or data.

Triggers can alert you when the following events occur:

- Machine telemetry data syncs from your local device to the Viam cloud
- Data syncs from a machine
- A service detects a specified object or classifies a specified label

For more information, see [Trigger configuration](/data-ai/reference/triggers-configuration/).
