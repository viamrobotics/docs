Services are built-in software packages for complex capabilities such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), computer vision, motion planning, and data collection.

Each service is typed by a proto API, such as the [service proto definitions](https://github.com/viamrobotics/api/tree/main/proto/viam/service).

For more information, see [Service APIs](/dev/reference/apis/#service-apis).
