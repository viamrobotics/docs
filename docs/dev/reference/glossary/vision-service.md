The **Vision Service** is a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="service" >}} in the Viam platform that enables machines to interpret visual data captured by {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="camera" text="cameras" >}} using computer vision and {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="ml" text="machine learning" >}} techniques.

The Vision Service provides capabilities for:

- **Object Detection**: Identifying and locating objects in 2D images by drawing bounding boxes around them
- **Image Classification**: Categorizing entire images into predefined classes
- **Segmentation**: Separating and identifying objects in 3D point clouds

Vision Services can use various models, including pre-trained models or custom models trained on your own data using Viam's {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="ml" text="ML" >}} platform.

The Vision Service is commonly used for applications such as:

- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Object recognition and tracking
- Quality control and inspection
- Navigation and mapping
