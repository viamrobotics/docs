The vision service is a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="service" >}} in the Viam platform that enables machines to interpret visual data captured by camera using computer vision and {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="ml" text="machine learning" >}} techniques.
Vision Services can use various models, including pre-trained models or custom models trained on your own data using the Viam platform.

The vision service provides capabilities for:

- **Object Detection**: Identifying and locating objects in 2D images by drawing bounding boxes around them
- **Image Classification**: Categorizing entire images into predefined classes
- **Segmentation**: Separating and identifying objects in 3D point clouds

The Vision Service is commonly used for applications such as obstacle detection and avoidance, object recognition and tracking, quality control and inspection, and navigation.
