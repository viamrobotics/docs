_Try Viam_ is a way to try out the Viam platform without setting up any hardware yourself.
You can take over a Viam Rover in our robotics lab for 15 minutes to play around!

Watch this tutorial video for a walkthrough of Try Viam, including [how to reserve a Viam Rover](#using-the-reservation-system), [navigate the Viam platform](/manage/app-usage/), and [drive the rover](../try-viam-tutorial/#control-tab):
