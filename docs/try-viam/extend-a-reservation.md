If the next time slot is open, you can click **Extend Reservation** on the [**Try** tab](https://app.viam.com/try).
You must do this *before your session ends* to reset the timer to 15 minutes.
When your session ends, you can no longer extend it but the robot's final configuration remains in your account.
If your session ends, you can always create a new reservation and [reuse the configuration](/try-viam/faq/#how-can-i-reuse-my-rented-rover).
