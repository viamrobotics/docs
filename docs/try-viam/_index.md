## Get started with Viam

During your rover rental, you can [try out some of the Viam platform functionality](try-viam-tutorial/):

- Drive the rover from wherever you are
- Use services like computer vision to identify colors and objects
- Explore the configuration and control interface for the rover's sensors and actuators in the Viam app
- Write code to control the rover

## Control your rover with SDKs

If you want to control and automate your rover with Python or Go, use the [Viam SDKs](/program/sdk-as-client).

Viam also exposes a gRPC [API for robot controls](https://github.com/viamrobotics/api).

Both the API and the SDKs support [WebRTC](https://webrtcforthecurious.com/).
The SDKs provide a wrapper around the viam-server [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API and streamline connection, authentication, and encryption against a server.
