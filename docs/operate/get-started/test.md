After you configure your machine, you can test your machine's configured resources by using the **TEST** panel of the component's config card.

This is useful for checking that:

- Your hardware is physically connected and has power
- Your configuration is correct
- Your instance of `viam-server` is able to access the hardware and connect to the Viam app

To test your machine:

1. Open the Viam app and navigate to the machine you want to test.

1. Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of the machine.

1. Click to expand the **TEST** panel of the component or service you want to test.

1. Interact with the component or service and verify that it is working as expected.
