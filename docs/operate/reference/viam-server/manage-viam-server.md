If you have manually [installed `viam-server`](/operate/get-started/setup/), you can chose to run it as a system service or directly on the command line.
Running as a system service enables you to configure `viam-server` to start automatically when your system boots, and is the [default installation option](/operate/get-started/setup/#installation-methods-viam-agent-versus-manual) on Linux.
Running on the command line is suitable for local development.

{{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
If you have installed `viam-agent`, see [Manage `viam-agent`](/manage/reference/viam-agent/manage-viam-agent/) instead.

## Run `viam-server`

Select the tab for your platform:

{{< tabs name="Managing viam-server">}}
{{% tab name="Linux"%}}

### Run as a system service

After [installation](/operate/get-started/setup/), the `viam-server` [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) binary will be located at <file>/usr/local/bin/viam-server</file>, and a `systemd` service file will be placed at <file>/etc/systemd/system/viam-server.service</file>.
By default, `viam-server` is configured to start when the machine boots.

Running `viam-server` as a system service is the recommended method for Linux.

You can use the following commands to manage `viam-server` when installed as a system service.
These commands require that you store your configuration file at <file>/etc/viam.json</file>.

#### Start

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl start viam-server
```

#### Stop

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl stop viam-server
```

#### Restart

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl restart viam-server
```

#### Enable (start automatically with system boot, default)

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl enable viam-server
```

#### Disable (do not start automatically with system boot)

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl disable viam-server
```

<br>

### Run from the command line

When running `viam-server` on the command line, you can use the following commands to manage the process.
If `viam-server` is already running as a system service, be sure to stop the service first before using these commands.

#### Start

Run the following on the command line to start `viam-server`, providing the path to your configuration file:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo viam-server -config /path/to/my/config.json
```

If you followed the [Installation Guide](/operate/get-started/setup/), your machine's configuration file is available at <file>/etc/viam.json</file>.
You can provide this path in the above command, or move the configuration file to a desired location and change the path in this command accordingly.

Note that on a Raspberry Pi, `viam-server` must always run as `root` (using `sudo`) in order to access the DMA subsystem for GPIO.
When running `viam-server` from your home directory on a Linux computer, you do not need to use `sudo`.

#### Stop

Press **Ctrl + C** on your keyboard within the terminal session where you are running `viam-server` to stop it.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="macOS"%}}

### Run from the command line

After [installation](/operate/get-started/setup/), `viam-server` can be run directly on the command line.

Running `viam-server` on the command line is the recommended method for macOS.

You can use the following commands to manage `viam-server` on the command line:

#### Start

Run the following on the command line to start `viam-server`, providing the path to your own configuration file:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
viam-server -config /path/to/my/config.json
```

If you followed the [Installation Guide](/operate/get-started/setup/), your machine's configuration file is available in your <file>~/Downloads/</file> directory, named similarly to <file>viam-machinename-main.json</file>.
You can provide this path in the above command, or move the configuration file to a desired location and change the path in this command accordingly.

#### Stop

Type **Ctrl + C** on your keyboard within the terminal session where you are running `viam-server` to stop it.

<br>

### Run as a system service

Installing `viam-server` as a system service is not recommended for most use cases on macOS.
However, if you are looking to create a machine that runs on macOS and you want it to run `viam-server` automatically when your macOS system boots, then you will need to run `viam-server` as a service.

Once you have [installed `viam-server`](/operate/get-started/setup/) on your macOS computer, use the following commands to control the service.
These commands require that you store your configuration file at <file>/opt/homebrew/etc/viam.json</file>.

#### Start

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew services start viam-server
```

#### Stop

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew services stop viam-server
```

#### Restart

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew services restart viam-server
```

## Update `viam-server`

The steps to update `viam-server` differ depending on your installation method.
To determine your installation method, check if the `viam-agent` process is running.
Run the following command:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$" data-output="2"}
ps aux | grep viam-agent
root      566431  0.5  0.2 1247148 20336 ?       Ssl  11:24   0:00 /opt/viam/bin/viam-agent --config /etc/viam.json
```

If the output includes a process named `viam-agent`, you used `viam-agent` to install `viam-server`.
Follow the steps to use `viam-agent` to update `viam-server`.

If the output does not include a process named `viam-agent`, you did not use `viam-agent`.
Follow the manual steps to update the standalone version.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Installed with viam-agent" %}}

By default, `viam-agent` automatically upgrades to the latest stable version of `viam-server`.
You can change this behavior in the [`version_control` settings of your machine](/manage/reference/viam-agent/#version_control-version-management-for-viam-agent-and-viam-server) in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).
For example, the following `version_control` configuration will always update to the latest stable release of `viam-agent` and the latest development release of `viam-server`:

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers" data-line=""}
{
  "agent": {
    "version_control": {
      "agent": "stable",
      "viam-server": "dev"
    }
  },
  "components": [ ... ]
}
```

To use the new versions of `viam-server` and `viam-agent`, [restart `viam-agent`](/manage/reference/viam-agent/manage-viam-agent/).
When you stop or restart `viam-agent`, the agent also restarts `viam-server`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Manual" %}}

To update to the newest RDK version, you need to update your `viam-server`.
Select the tab for your platform:

{{< tabs name="Updating viam-server" >}}
{{% tab name=Linux %}}

`viam-server` is distributed for Linux as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/), and includes a built-in self-update feature.
When you [run `viam-server`](#run-viam-server) as a service on Linux, it will check for updates automatically on launch, and update itself if a newer version is detected.

The automatic update behavior of `viam-server` should meet the needs of most deployments, but if you need to manually force an update, you can do so with the `--aix-update` flag:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo viam-server --aix-update
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name=macOS %}}

`viam-server` is distributed for macOS through the Homebrew package manager, which includes a built-in update feature.

To upgrade to the latest version of `viam-server` using Homebrew:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
brew upgrade viam-server
```

Homebrew does not support automatic updates, so you will need to manually perform this step each time you wish to check for updates.
We recommend running `brew upgrade viam-server` on a regular basis.

### Disable automatic updates

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Installed with viam-agent" %}}

To disable automatic updates, configure the [`version_control` settings of your machine](/manage/reference/viam-agent/#version_control-version-management-for-viam-agent-and-viam-server) in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/) to a specific version number.
For example, the following `version_control` configuration pins `viam-server` to version `0.52.1`, preventing `viam-server` from updating to a more recent version:

```json {class="line-numbers linkable-line-numbers" data-line=""}
{
  "agent": {
    "version_control": {
      "agent": "stable",
      "viam-server": "0.52.1"
    }
  },
  "components": [ ... ]
}
```

If you are changing to a different version of `viam-server` and `viam-agent`, [restart `viam-agent`](/manage/reference/viam-agent/manage-viam-agent/).
When you stop or restart `viam-agent`, the agent also restarts `viam-server`.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Manual" %}}

`viam-server` automatically checks for updates.
On Linux, you can disable automatic `viam-server` updates.
To disable the updates, open <file>/etc/systemd/system/viam-server.service</file> and comment out the line that starts with `ExecStartPre`.
Add a `#` character at the beginning of the line so that it matches the following:

```sh
# ExecStartPre=-/usr/local/bin/viam-server --aix-update
```

Then, reload the service file with the following command:

```sh {class="command-line" data-prompt="$"}
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

To resume automatic update checking, delete the leading `#` character in <file>/etc/systemd/system/viam-server.service</file>, then run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` again.
