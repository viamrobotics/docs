A discovery service allows you to return a list of physical hardware available on a machine, and suggest configurations for those components to integrate the hardware into the machine.
If you are [creating a modular resource](/operate/get-started/other-hardware/) that depends on other {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}} that are discoverable in a systematic way, you can create a discovery service as part of your module to discover those resources.

## Example usage

Imagine you are creating a vision service module that depends on a camera.
To make it easier for users to configure the camera, you include a discovery service in your module.
You implement the discovery service to report all the camera paths your computer or SBC finds.
Users of your module can then:

1. Configure both the vision service and the discovery service in their machine's configuration.
1. Click the **Test** panel in the discovery service configuration to see all cameras recognized by the machine, presented as a list of configuration snippets.
1. Create a camera with the copy-pasteable configuration snippet for the camera they want to use, with the camera path already filled in.
1. Use the configured camera in their vision service configuration.

To interact with a discovery service programmatically, use the [discovery service API](/dev/reference/apis/services/discovery/).

## Configuration

To use a discovery service, you need to add it to your machine's configuration.

Go to your machine's **CONFIGURE** page, and add your discovery service.

The following list shows the available discovery service models.
For additional configuration information, click on the model name:

{{% tab name="viam-server" %}}

{{<resources api="rdk:service:discovery" type="discovery" no-intro="true">}}

{{< readfile "/static/include/create-your-own-mr.md" >}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Micro-RDK" %}}

{{< alert title="Support Notice" color="note" >}}

There is currently no support for this component compatible with the Micro-RDK.
