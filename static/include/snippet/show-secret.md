{{< alert title="API key and API key id" color="info" >}}
By default, the sample code does not include your robot API key and API key id.
We strongly recommend that you add your API key and API key id as an environment variable and import this variable into your development environment as needed.

To show your robot's API key and API key id in the sample code, toggle **Include secret** on the **Code sample** tab.
You can also see your API key and API key id on your robot's **Security** tab.
