{{< alert title="Location secret" color="info" >}}
By default, the sample code does not include your robot location secret.
We strongly recommend that you add your location secret as an environment variable and import this variable into your development environment as needed.

To show your robot's location secret in the sample code, toggle **Include secret** on the **Code sample** tab.
You can also see your location secret on the [locations page](/manage/fleet/locations/).
