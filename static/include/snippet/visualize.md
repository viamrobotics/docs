You can visualize your machine's geometries and frames in the Viam app:

{{% alert title="Tip" color="tip" %}}
To visualize a component without moving any real-world hardware, configure a `fake` model to represent your component (for example, a [`fake` arm](/operate/reference/components/arm/fake/)), then follow the steps below using the fake component.
{{% /alert %}}

1. In Viam, navigate to your machine's page.
1. Make sure your machine is live and connected to Viam.
   **If your machine is not live, the visualization will not display.**
1. Select the **VISUALIZE** tab.

   {{<imgproc src="/operate/mobility/arm-viz.png" resize="x1100" declaredimensions=true alt="Visualization of a series of pill-shaped links forming an arm, above a grid." style="width:700px" class="shadow imgzoom" >}}

1. Scroll to zoom, click and drag to tilt, and right-click and drag to pan.

1. Use the tree menu or click on the visualization to select a component, link, or other object to display its position, orientation, and dimensions.

1. You can go to the **CONTROL** tab, move your components, and then return to the **VISUALIZE** tab to see the updated visualization.
