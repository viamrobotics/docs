The micro-RDK is a lightweight version of the {{% glossary_tooltip term_id="rdk" text="Robot Development Kit (RDK)"%}} which can run on resource-limited embedded systems that cannot run the fully-featured [`viam-server`](/get-started/viam/).

The only microcontroller the micro-RDK currently supports is the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32).

[Client API](/appendix/apis/) usage with the micro-RDK currently supports the following {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="resource" text="resources" >}}:
