1. **Click on the "TRY" tab in the Viam app.**

   Log in to Viam and go to the **[TRY](https://app.viam.com/try)** tab.
   (If you don't have an account, it only takes a minute to sign up.)
2. **Click "Try Now" or "Reserve Rover" to reserve your slot.**

   The Try Viam landing page displays the **Next time slot** or **Estimated Time to Start** and other status information.
   If no one's using a Viam Rover, you'll take over immediately.
   Otherwise, you'll see an estimated time for the next slot on the TRY tab.
   If your reserved time slot is more than 30 minutes away, we'll send you an email confirming your reservation and an email when it's your turn to use the rover.

   When it is your turn to take over a Viam Rover, the status on the **[TRY](https://app.viam.com/try)** tab changes to **SETTING UP ROBOT**.
   Once that is complete, the status on the TRY tab changes to **RUNNING**, and you can click “**Try Your Robot**” to access your rented Viam Rover.

   {{< alert title="Note" color="note" >}}
   Viam creates a location called “Rover Rental” in your account's organization, and adds a Viam Rover with a basic config and a random name (like wispy-shape) as a robot in this location.

3. **Click "Try Your Robot" to use your Viam Rover.**

   You’ll be able to control a Viam Rover in the Viam robotics lab for 15 minutes.
   You can see a session timer in the top banner.

   You can see the rover's configuration, write code to control the rover, drive the rover, and more.
