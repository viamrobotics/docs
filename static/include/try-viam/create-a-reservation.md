1. **Click on the "TRY VIAM" button in the Viam app.**

   Log in to Viam and click on the **[TRY VIAM](https://app.viam.com/try)** button in the top navigation bar.
   If you don't have an account, it only takes a minute to sign up.

2. **Click "TRY NOW" or "RESERVE ROVER" to reserve your slot.**

   The Try Viam landing page displays the **Next time slot** or **Estimated Time to Start** and other status information.
   If no one is using a Viam Rover, you'll take over immediately.
   Otherwise, you'll see an estimated time for the next slot on the TRY tab.
   If your reserved time slot is more than 30 minutes away, we'll send you an email confirming your reservation and an email when it's your turn to use the rover.

   When it is your turn to take over a Viam Rover, the page will show that it is configuring your rover.
   Once that is complete, you can click **TRY MY ROVER** to access your rented Viam Rover.
