During your rental, if the next time slot is open, you can click **EXTEND** at the top of the page in the control bar.
If the option is not available, that means there is another reservation waiting.
You must do this *before your session ends* to reset the timer to 15 minutes.
Once your session has ended, you can no longer access this option, but the robot's final configuration will remain in your account.
You can always create a new reservation and [reuse the configuration](/try-viam/faq/#how-can-i-reuse-my-rented-rover) to experience Try Viam again.
