During your rental, if the next time slot is open, you can click **Extend** at the top of the page in the control bar.
If the option is not available, that means there is another reservation waiting.
You must do this *before your session ends* to reset the timer.
Once your session has ended, you can no longer access this option, but the robot's final configuration will remain in your account.
You can always create a new reservation and [reuse the configuration](/get-started/try-viam/faq/#how-can-i-reuse-my-rented-rover) to experience Try Viam again.
