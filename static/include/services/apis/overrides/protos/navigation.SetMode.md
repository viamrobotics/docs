Set the `Mode` the service is operating in.

There are two options for modes: `MODE_MANUAL` or `MODE_WAYPOINT`.

- `MODE_WAYPOINT`: Start to look for added waypoints and begin autonomous navigation.
- `MODE_MANUAL`: Stop autonomous navigation between waypoints and allow the base to be controlled manually.
