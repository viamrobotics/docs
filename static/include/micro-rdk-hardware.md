### Hardware requirements

You need an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller to use the micro-RDK.
Viam recommends purchasing the ESP32 with a [development board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits).
The following ESP32 microcontrollers are supported:

- [ESP32-WROOM Series](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32)
- [ESP32-WROVER Series](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32)

Your microcontroller should have the following resources available to work with the micro-RDK:

- 2 Cores + 384kB SRAM + 4MB Flash

The main difference between the WROOM and WROVER is that the WROVER has additional RAM.
If you would like to send large messages to your device or use the Viam app control page on the device, we recommend using the WROVER.
