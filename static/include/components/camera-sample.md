This reads a single image from a [camera](/components/camera/) called "camera0" on the robot.

The following example assumes you have a camera called `camera0` configured as a component of your robot.
If your camera has a different name in the Viam app, change the `name` in the example.

robot = await connect() # refer to connect code above

// grab the camera from the robot

myCam, err := camera.FromRobot(robot, cameraName)
if err != nil {
  logger.Fatalf("cannot get camera: %v", err)
}

// gets the stream from a camera
camStream, err := myCam.Stream(context.Background())

// gets an image from the camera stream
img, release, err := camStream.Next(context.Background())
defer release()
