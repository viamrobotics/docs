Get all the geometries associated with the input controller in its current configuration, in the [frame](/services/frame-system/) of the input controller.
The [motion](/services/motion/) and [navigation](/services/navigation/) services use the relative position of inherent geometries to configured geometries representing obstacles for collision detection and obstacle avoidance while motion planning.
