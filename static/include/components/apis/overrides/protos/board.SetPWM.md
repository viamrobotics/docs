Set the pin's [Pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation/duty-cycle): a float [`0.0`, `1.0`] indicating the percentage of time the digital signal output of this pin is in the high state (active, >0V) relative to the interval period of the PWM signal [(interval period being the mathematical inverse of the PWM frequency)](https://learn.adafruit.com/improve-brushed-dc-motor-performance/pwm-frequency).
