[Pulse-width modulation (PWM)](https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/pulse-width-modulation) is a method where of transmitting a digital signal in the form of pulses to control analog circuits.
With PWM on a _board_, the continuous digital signal output by a GPIO pin is sampled at regular intervals and transmitted to any hardware components wired to the pin that read analog signals.
This enables the board to communicate with these components.

Get the pin's [pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation/duty-cycle): a float [`0.0`, `1.0`] representing the percentage of time the digital signal output by this pin is in the high state (active, >0V) relative to the interval period of the PWM signal [(interval period being the mathematical inverse of the PWM frequency)](https://learn.adafruit.com/improve-brushed-dc-motor-performance/pwm-frequency).
