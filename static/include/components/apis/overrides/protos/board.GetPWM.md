[Pulse-width modulation (PWM)](https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/pulse-width-modulation) is a method where of transmitting a digital signal in the form of pulses to control analog circuits.
With PWM on a _board_, the continuous digital signal output by a GPIO pin is sampled at regular intervals and transmitted to any [hardware components](/machine/components/) wired to the pin that read analog signals.
This enables the board to communicate with these components.

Get the pin's [pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation/duty-cycle): a float [`0.0`, `1.0`] representing the percentage of time the digital signal output by this pin is in the high state (active, >0V) relative to the interval period of the PWM signal [(interval period being the mathematical inverse of the PWM frequency)](https://learn.adafruit.com/improve-brushed-dc-motor-performance/pwm-frequency).
