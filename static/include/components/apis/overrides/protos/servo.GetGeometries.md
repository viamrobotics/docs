Get all the geometries associated with the servo in its current configuration, in the [frame](/mobility/frame-system/) of the servo.
The [motion](/mobility/motion/) and [navigation](/mobility/navigation/) services use the relative position of inherent geometries to configured geometries representing obstacles for collision detection and obstacle avoidance while motion planning.
