Get the [Pulse-width modulation (PWM) frequency](https://learn.adafruit.com/improve-brushed-dc-motor-performance/pwm-frequency) in Hertz (Hz) of this pin, the count of PWM interval periods per second.
The optimal value for PWM Frequency depends on the type and model of [component](/machine/components/) you control with the signal output by this pin.
Refer to your device's data sheet for PWM Frequency specifications.
