Get all the geometries associated with the generic component in its current configuration, in the [frame](/machine/services/frame-system/) of the generic component.
The [motion](/machine/services/motion/) and [navigation](/machine/services/navigation/) services use the relative position of inherent geometries to configured geometries representing obstacles for collision detection and obstacle avoidance while motion planning.
