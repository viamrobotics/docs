The percentage of max power of the base's linear propulsion.
In the range of -1.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning 100% power.
Viam's coordinate system considers +Y to be the forward axis (+/- X right/left, +/- Z up/down), so use the Y component of this vector to move forward and backward when controlling a wheeled base.
Positive "Y" values imply moving forwards.
Negative "Y" values imply moving backwards.
