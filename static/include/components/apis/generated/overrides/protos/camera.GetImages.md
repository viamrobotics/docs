{{% alert title="Usage" color="note" %}}
Intended specifically for use with cameras that support simultaneous depth and color image streams, like the [Intel RealSense](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/realsense) or the [Luxonis OAK-D](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/oak-d).
If your camera does not have multiple imagers, this method will work without capturing multiple images simultaneously.

You can use the [`rgb-d-overlay` module](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/rgb-d-overlay) to view and compare the camera streams returned by this method.
See the [module readme](https://github.com/viam-labs/rgb-d-overlay) for further instructions.
