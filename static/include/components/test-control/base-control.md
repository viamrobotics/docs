After you configure the base, open the base's **TEST** panel on the [**CONFIGURE**](/configure/) or [**CONTROL**](/fleet/control/) tabs to view the controls to enable keyboard or discrete control over your machine's movement.

In the **Quick move** section, you can toggle the keyboard control to active.
With the **Keyboard** toggle active, use **W** and **S** to go forward and back, and **A** and **D** to arc and spin.

Try driving your base around using the WASD keyboard controls.

You can also move straight, spin, set power or set velocity from the base panel.

If you do not see the base card in the **TEST** panel, check the **LOGS** tab for possible setup or configuration errors.
