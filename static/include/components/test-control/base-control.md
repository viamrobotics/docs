After you configure the base, go to the [**CONTROL**](/app/fleet/control/) tab and expand the base component to view the controls to enable keyboard or [discrete](/get-started/try-viam/try-viam-tutorial/#discrete-movement-control) control over your machine's movement.
If your base makes use of a [camera](/machine/components/camera/) component, the **CONTROL** tab for your base will also display a **Live Feeds** section.
This section contains buttons to toggle cameras on or off and to arrange how you view the camera feeds.

On the **Keyboard** tab, you can toggle the keyboard control to active.
With the **Keyboard** toggle active, use **W** and **S** to go forward and back, and **A** and **D** to arc and spin.

Try driving your base around using the WASD keyboard controls.

If you navigate to the **Discrete** tab, you can use movement modes such as `Straight` and `Spin` and different movement types such as `Continuous` and `Discrete` and directions such as `Forwards` and `Backwards`.

If you do not see the base card in the **CONTROL** tab, check the **LOGS** tab for possible setup or configuration errors.
