## Test the gantry

Once your gantry is configured and connected, go to the [**Control** tab](/manage/fleet/robots/#control) and click on the gantry's dropdown panel.

Use the panel to adjust the position of the actuator on the axis and check whether it moves as expected.

If the gantry does not appear on the **Control** tab, or if you notice unexpected behavior, check your robot's [**Logs** tab](/manage/fleet/robots/#logs) for errors, and review the configuration.
