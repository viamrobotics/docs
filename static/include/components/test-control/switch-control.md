Once you have configured your switch, navigate to the [**CONTROL** tab](/operate/control/web-app/) and click on the switch component.

Here you can:

- **View current position**: See the current position of the switch and its label (if configured).
- **Change position**: Use the dropdown to select a different position. The dropdown will show position labels if they are configured, otherwise it will show "Position 0", "Position 1", etc.
- **Get position information**: Click **GET POSITION** to retrieve the current position.
- **Get position count and labels**: Click **GET NUMBER OF POSITIONS** to see how many positions the switch has and their labels.

The switch control interface will automatically update to show the available positions and their labels based on your switch configuration.
