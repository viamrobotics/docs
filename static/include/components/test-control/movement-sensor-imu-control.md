## Test the movement sensor

After you configure your movement sensor, open the movement sensor's **TEST** panel on the [**CONFIGURE**](/configure/) or [**CONTROL**](/fleet/control/) tabs.
This panel presents the data collected by the movement sensor.
The sections in the panel include the orientation, angular velocity and linear acceleration.
