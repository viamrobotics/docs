## Test the arm

Once your arm is configured and connected, go to the [**CONTROL** tab](/fleet/control/) and click on the arm's dropdown panel.

Use the buttons to move the end position or the joints and check whether it moves as expected.

If the arm does not appear on the **CONTROL** tab, or if you notice unexpected behavior, check your machine's [**LOGS** tab](/fleet/machines/#logs) for errors, and review the configuration.
