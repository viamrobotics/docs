## Test the sensor

After you configure your sensor, navigate to the [Control tab](/platform/fleet/robots/#control) and select the **Sensors** dropdown panel.
If you have multiple sensors configured, your sensor will be listed here among others.
To access detailed readings from your sensor, select the **Get Readings** button.
