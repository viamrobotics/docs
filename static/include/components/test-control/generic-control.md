## Test the generic component

After you configure your generic component, navigate to the [**CONTROL** tab](/fleet/machines/#control) and select the dropdown panel dedicated to the generic component.
Use the card to send arbitrary commands to the resource with [`DoCommand()`](/components/generic/#docommand).
