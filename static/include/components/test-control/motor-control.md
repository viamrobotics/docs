Once your motor is configured and connected, open the motor's **TEST** panel on the [**CONFIGURE**](/configure/) or [**CONTROL**](/fleet/control/) tabs.
Use the buttons to try turning your motor forwards or backwards at different power levels and check whether it moves as expected.

If the motor does not appear on the **TEST** panel, or if you notice unexpected behavior, check your machine's [**LOGS** tab](/cloud/machines/#logs) for errors, and review the configuration.
