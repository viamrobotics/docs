Once your motor is configured and connected, go to the [**CONTROL** tab](/fleet/machines/#control) and click on the motor's dropdown panel.
Use the buttons to try turning your motor forwards or backwards at different power levels and check whether it moves as expected.

If the motor does not appear on the **CONTROL** tab, or if you notice unexpected behavior, check your machine's [**LOGS** tab](/fleet/machines/#logs) for errors, and review the configuration.
