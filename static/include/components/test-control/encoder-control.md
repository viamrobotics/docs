## Test the encoder

Once your encoder is configured and connected, open the encoders's **TEST** panel on the [**CONFIGURE**](/configure/) or [**CONTROL**](/fleet/control/) tabs.
The ticks count is displayed.
Try moving the encoder (for example, by turning a motor it is attached to) and check whether the count increases as expected.

If the encoder does not appear on the **TEST** panel, or if you notice unexpected behavior, check your machine's [**LOGS** tab](/cloud/machines/#logs) for errors, and review the configuration.
