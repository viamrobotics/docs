## Test the encoder

Once your encoder is configured and connected, go to the [**Control** tab](/fleet/machines/#control) and click on the encoder's dropdown panel.
The ticks count is displayed.
Try moving the encoder (for example, by turning a motor it is attached to) and check whether the count increases as expected.

If the encoder does not appear on the **Control** tab, or if you notice unexpected behavior, check your machine's [**Logs** tab](/fleet/machines/#logs) for errors, and review the configuration.
