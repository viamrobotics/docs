## Test the base

After you configure the base, go to the [control](/manage/fleet/robots/#control) tab and expand the base component in order to enable keyboard or [discrete](https://docs.viam.com/try-viam/try-viam-tutorial/#discrete-movement-control) control over your robot's movement. The Live Feed section contains buttons to toggle cameras on or off and to arrange how you view the camera feeds.
