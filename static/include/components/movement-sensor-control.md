## Test the movement sensor

After you configure your movement sensor, navigate to the [Control tab](/manage/fleet/robots/#control) and select the dedicated movement sensor dropdown panel.
This panel presents the data collected by the movement sensor.
The sections in the panel include the position, orientation, angular velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration.
