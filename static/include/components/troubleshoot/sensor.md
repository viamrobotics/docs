If your sensor is not working as expected, follow these steps:

1. Check your machine logs on the **LOGS** tab to check for errors.
1. Review this sensor model's documentation to ensure you have configured all required attributes.
1. Check that any wires are securely attached to the correct pins, if appropriate.
1. Click on the **TEST** panel on the **CONFIGURE** or **CONTROL** tab and test if you can use the sensor there. The sensor will show JSON readings and data URI encoded images.

If none of these steps work, reach out to us on the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/viam) and we will be happy to help.
