Once you have configured your digital interrupts, open the board's **TEST** panel on the [**CONFIGURE**](/configure/) or [**CONTROL**](/fleet/control/) tabs to monitor interrupt activity.
The value displayed next to each interrupt name represents the total count of interrupts triggered by the corresponding digital interrupt.
