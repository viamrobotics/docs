Once your camera is configured and connected, go to the [**CONTROL** tab](/fleet/control/), and click on the camera's dropdown menu.
Then toggle the camera or the Point Cloud Data view to ON.
If everything is configured correctly, you will see the live video feed from your camera.

After expanding the **TEST** section on the configuration pane, you can select **Export screenshot** to export a screenshot of the video feed to your computer.
You can also select **Toggle picture in picture** to open a new window outside of your browser with the video feed displayed.
You can change the refresh rate through the dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the test pane.
