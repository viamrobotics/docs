- At least 15 images, more images result in better models
- At least 80% of the images have labels
- For each training label, at least 10 examples

When you label your dataset, include:

- images with and _without_ the categories you're looking to identify
- a roughly equal number of images for each category
- images from your production environment, using the same backgrounds, lighting, camera quality, and focus
- examples from every angle and distance that you expect the model to handle
