`viam-server` is distributed for Linux as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/).
The AppImage is a single, self-contained binary that runs on 64-bit Linux systems running the `aarch64` or `x86_64` architectures, with no need to install any dependencies.

To install `viam-server` :

1. Go to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) and [add a new robot](/manage/fleet/robots/#add-a-new-robot).
   If this is your first time using the Viam app, you must create an account first.

1. On the **Setup** tab, select `Linux (Aarch64)`.

1. Follow the steps shown on the **Setup** tab to install `viam-server` on your Linux computer.

1. Once `viam-server` is installed and running, return to the **Setup** page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com) and wait for confirmation that your computer has successfully connected.

By default, `viam-server` will start automatically when your system boots, but you can [change this behavior](/installation/manage/) if desired.
