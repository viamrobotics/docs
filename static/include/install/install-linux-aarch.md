`viam-server` is the open-source software that drives your hardware and connects your device to the cloud.
Install `viam-server` on the computer or single-board computer (SBC) that is directly connected to your hardware (for example sensors, cameras, or motors):

1. Make sure your computer or SBC is powered on and connected to the internet.

1. Create a Viam account on [app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com).
   You can configure and manage devices and data collection in the web UI.

1. Create a new [_{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="machine" text="machine" >}}_](/operate/hello-world/quickstart/#machines) using the **Add machine** button in the top right corner of the **LOCATIONS** tab in the app.
   A machine represents your device.

1. On your machine's page, click **View setup instructions**.

1. Select **Linux / Aarch64**.

1. Select your installation method:

   - `viam-agent` (recommended): installs viam-agent, which will automatically install (and update) viam-server **and** provide additional functionality such as [provisioning](/manage/fleet/provision/setup/) and operating system update configuration.
   - `manual`: installs only `viam-server` on your machine.

1. Follow the instructions on the page to install `viam-server` and connect it to the cloud with your machineâ€™s unique credentials.

1. After you install `viam-server`, a secure connection is automatically established between your machine and Viam.
   When you update your machine's configuration, `viam-server` automatically gets the updates.

   You are ready to [configure supported hardware](/operate/modules/configure-modules/) on your machine.
