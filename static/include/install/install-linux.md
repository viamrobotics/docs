`viam-server` is distributed for Linux as an AppImage.
The AppImage is a single, self-contained binary that runs on 64-bit Linux systems running the `aarch64` or `x86_64` architectures, with no need to install any dependencies (except for FUSE, which is required by the AppImage format).

To install `viam-server` on a Linux computer:

1. Go to the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com). Create an account if you haven't already.

1. Add a new machine by providing a name in the **New machine** field and clicking **Add machine**:

1. Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab and find your machine's card.
   An alert will be present directing you to **Set up your machine part**:

   Click **View setup instructions** to open the setup instructions.

1. Select the appropriate architecture for your machine: **Linux / Aarch64**, **Linux / x86_64**, or **Linux / Armv7l**.
   On most Linux operating systems, you can run `uname -m` to confirm your computer's architecture.

1. If you selected **Linux / Aarch 64** or **Linux / x86** also select your installation method:

   - `viam-agent` (recommended): installs viam-agent, which will automatically install (and update) viam-server **and** provide additional functionality such as [provisioning](/manage/fleet/provision/setup/) and operating system update configuration.
   - `manual`: installs only `viam-server` on your machine.

1. Follow the instructions listed.

1. Once you have followed the steps on the setup instructions, wait for confirmation that your machine has successfully connected.

   On your machine's page on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com), your machine will show that it's **Live**.

By default, `viam-server` will start automatically when your system boots, but you can [change this behavior](/operate/reference/viam-server/manage-viam-server/) if desired.
