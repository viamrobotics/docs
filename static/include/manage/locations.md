In Viam, every robot belongs to a location.
A location is a virtual grouping of robots that allows you to organize robots and manage access.
Generally, a location defines a group of robots that are geographically close to each other.

For example, an organization called Good Robots Inc has two warehouses across New York and Oregon.
Good Robots Inc can organize its robots into three locations based on their physical presence in a warehouse.

You can also use locations as proxies for environments such as "Production" and "Testing" or other groupings.
Locations do not have to correspond with physical locations.

Each robot you add to Viam belongs to a location.
Each location belongs to an organization.
