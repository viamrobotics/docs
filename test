WARN 2023/06/02 19:32:07 .Path when the page is backed by a file is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We plan to use Path for a canonical source path and you probably want to check the source is a file. To get the current behaviour, you can use a construct similar to the one below:

  {{ $path := "" }}
  {{ with .File }}
	{{ $path = .Path }}
  {{ else }}
	{{ $path = .Path }}

"Overview The following sections contain links that we think you will find useful during your journey into robotics.\nBasic Electronics Hobby Servos Hobby servos are a type of actuator comprising a small motor with built-in closed-loop control. They are useful for precise positioning, usually limited to a 180 degree range of angles. Continuous rotation servos are also available that maintain a speed rather than a position.\nMechanism Hobby servos contain a small electric motor, a series of gears, and a potentiometer attached to the shaft to act as an encoder."
